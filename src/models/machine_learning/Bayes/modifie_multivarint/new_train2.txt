0 basic uml used
0 the test plan is comprehensive
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too the explanation along with diagram provides enough information to understand the usecase
1 the test plan added is just a basic case and a the change are just some calculation to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project
0 yes their design is clear and sound and the principle and pattern are well used
1 a simple enough explanation ha been provided for how the functionality will be working suggestion i feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately for example what different possible method will be implemented or how the web service will be used or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection
0 team ha done a good job in identifying the case that need to be tested it will be an improvement if they can add detail on how they plan to test each controllerview separately
0 follows appropriate design principle and pattern
0 simple and easy to understand step
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 the team have thoroughly explained the change that need to be made and how they intend to make those change
0 yes their design is very sound and principle and pattern are used appropriately
0 it is easy to follow the change that the author have proposed
0 test plan look to be an overview of the functionality in the test plan i see the functionality explained l
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 it incorporates most of the functionality
1 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution they have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution
0 flow diagram explains the flow correctly
0 yes change to be made are clearly explained
0 the author have added uml diagram a requested in the previous review and it ha made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
0 yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
0 they team ha done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation they have already included the test they are writing for the functionality implementation they have covered the exhaustive scenario for the project in their test their test plan is highly appreciative
0 the entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirement the document aligns with the plan of action and showcase the exact purpose of the project
1 the design look a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system it can make the code smelly too complicated code handled in issue which could be refactored
0 all basic element are included
1 i would appreciate a little more detail on bug and which have a flow established but no code snippet
0 the proposed change have been explained in a simple manner
1 the author ha given a proper explanation of how the thing will be implemented by specifying the file that need to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grade
1 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work but they are not so lucid so a to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the change in the system
1 the author have proposed change that they are planning to implement however they have not included how they will go on to implement these change
0 given uml diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change
0 the explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project all the step piece up the project completely
1 most of part are included but they should include more detail in their doc
0 yes the design try to cover all the requested feature
0 the doc is very succinct and well written
0 document look complete
0 well done on adding almost everything
0 author have proposed solution in detail and is understandable
0 yes a far a i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned all the github metric mentioned in the requirement doc
1 the background and the implementation plan is provided with detail the file to be modified for each objective of the project is also stated testing plan is not stated
0 yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team ha achieved in term of the required change
1 the wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable but the wiki doe not include any test plan a of now there are a few test case which can be used to write the test plan for eg not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system
0 they have explained very well
0 the design change a described are sound they are mostly on javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code smelly
0 no their section solution design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
0 the team ha done a commendable job in creating a very detailed uml diagram and explaining the case of every user very well
0 the uml diagram are detailed and explained well suggestion the application flow could be explained in point so that the reviewer ha a clearer view of what is the sequence of event occurring
0 no test are required for the project a stated
0 yes only a few file are being modified
1 the author have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an er diagram however the diagram is a little high level and doe not completely explain the flow of the system
1 the explanation are good but a layout in the issuesolution form listed sequentially would have looked better
0 yes the design look accurate and well thought through
1 make include more detail for test plan other than that the wiki look very good
0 yes the design follows appropriate principle and pattern suggestion not required
1 the change proposed by the author are reasonable they do not introduce any clutter or inconsistency to the code however issue and do not have a clear solution in one case change to the assignment controller are proposed but it can not be inferred how adequate those change will be
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too the explanation along with diagram provides enough information to understand the usecase
0 yes change to be made are explained clearly document is very clear includes necessary diagram mockups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issue are and what team is planning to do to resolve them everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mockup no suggestion required
1 i think you explained the change they want to make clear but maybe you can state which file you want to make and how you guy want to change that file
0 they have mentioned about possible test required for the project
0 yes design is informative change proposal is detailed it describes well about how change are to be implemented
0 yes the design appears to be simple
0 the design document includes proper visualization it included appropriate flow chart and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project
0 no problem found they are trying to implement the dry principle
0 yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
0 yes look clean any design pattern used
0 a the project is more of adding feature to the user interface of the website the design plan is covering all the necessary step that need to be implemented
0 adding a language column to the course table make sense and so doe leveraging thirdparty apis to handle the translation
1 the author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual change are to be made is not yet clear a work on the project might not have started yet
0 design is simple and easy to understand
0 change suggested look good
1 the design seems to be good it is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the file that they plan to add and the method in said file however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we havent advanced to the implementation stage yet the author seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem i think they should go ahead and use the gem
1 they have a uml diagram which pretty much doe it job i am not in favor of the ui mockups they have put they could have used any software for the same which would have made it legible
1 test plan is not present
1 since no solution ha been proposed yet this couldnt be reviewed
1 a mentioned previously the ui mockups are decent but dont necessarily convey the overall design concept to those not familiar with the expertiza system
1 no uml diagram
0 the overall quality of explanation is very detailed and good i might even take few idea from here to improve my own design doc
0 great use of uml diagram flowchart and mockups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work it is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like
0 the flow diagram is good make understanding easier
1 the explanation of how the received data will be storedpresented is something i would suggest the team to add the design document also miss out on where the data will be presented in the view
0 they clearly understand this software design process and expertiza than me so i trust their judgement
1 it seems to me that the implementation of the project ha not started yet hence the exact place in the expertiza code where they plan to make change is missing this should be added in my opinion additionally they have explained very well a to what change need to be done and how they will be done so good job there
1 no design proposed can not check any mistake of the design decision
1 the test plan give a black box testing view which is good and easy to understand but it would be helpful to give more detail about what functionality are tested like a new db table is added so test related to that and corner case such a an old assignment get removed foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better
0 yes the design includes a test plan the test really test the functionality and also test adverse condition to see whether error message are being shown
0 the flow and uml diagram are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow addition of detailed use case help support the diagram
0 yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current expected state and uml diagram showing the flow diagram it depicts that once the analyze button is clicked the request is sent a json which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the api which generates the suggestion metric the response contains the suggestion metric like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestion chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop word
0 yes all the issue mentioned in the project description are covered along with their proposed solution good job
1 visual aid are missing entirely no class diagram are provided either tip you couldve provided simple chart or er diagram for the design
0 yes it is complete
0 the design seems to be flawless all the principle and pattern used are flawless and to the point
0 there are visual aid included with the design depicting the current state of the system a well a proposed icon to institute the design change
0 the design document cover all the possible case and should be fine
1 the document doe not go much into the technical detail the limited detail provided sound right however more research will generate better understanding
1 the change are not yet proposed
0 the test case cover all of the functionality that they are going to implement
0 yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
0 a lot of visuals very helpful when viewer walk through the design
1 no change proposed
0 the test plan is comprehensive
0 yes
0 yes the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality we want student to know if theyre giving helpful feedback and we want the nlp algorithm to be local to the expertiza project to decrease it reaction time they have at least shown that they are going to add button
0 good use of both diagram and table
1 they have very well stated of about the purpose of their project they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graph they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor they have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but havent specified which file need to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 the design is properly designed
1 there were mockups of how the analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric however there is no mockup for how the response would be displayedsuggestions i would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big i would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the component of the response from the api or just a few
1 team have decided to give all detail after final submission a design doc should be available before starting the project i would recommend to provide few detail on project design class involved in the project or application flow etc
0 the team ha suggested reasonable change to address the problem statement and ha given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation
1 they have very well stated of about the purpose of their project they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graph they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor they have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but havent specified which file need to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete
0 yes it doe appear to be following appropriate principle
1 the doc is well written with all the necessary explanation more detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document
1 the team ha proposed many change although it is not clear which approach or what exact change they plan to make
0 lot of great visualization are provided that outline a good amount of detail
1 a mentioned no design diagram are present
0 it wa weird that two of the bug they were assigned dont exist but thats not the team fault
0 the design seems to be a simple a possible author have not unnecessarily complicated the approach but rather have given a simple approach for various fix
1 the team ha included screenshots of the review ui the first one depicts the existing look and the nd one show that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student ha reviewed and also display a popup message showing the result of suggestion metric like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric the team ha also shown the user story in connextra format and also described to scenario one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input the team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow char uml diagram for use case or sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenario they plan to implement
0 the test case described will cover the functionality described given that they write multiple test with the same structure a described for all search criterion
0 the necessary visual input to aid explanation are present
1 the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge case may need to be considered at a later stage
1 the document doe not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mention the step to be done in order to implement the required functionality
0 explanation is quite easy to understand
0 yes they did
0 the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
0 yes i think the document includes everything a expected
0 the design look fine but no explanation a to why this is done is it already existing or is this a new feature
0 very good use of class and sequence diagram to explain the entire design flow it clearly conveys the thought process of author and the overall design
1 design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good
1 though the ui mockup explains the functionality it could have been more legible
1 the test plan doe include a high level of testing scenario the team plan to cover i would suggest the team should add bdd test so they can test the same after the development phase is over
0 the project documentation look complete with clear detail about the purpose to enable the student to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metric like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric they have delineated the design that includes the file that the team proposes to change the view appviewsresponseresponsehtmlerb and the partial appviewssubmittedcontentselfreviewhtmlerb the screenshot of the existing ui of the review section and how the ui would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metric will emerge when the button is clicked i specifically like how the test plan includes their feature in the connextra format they have mentioned scenario one where the student click the button without entering text in which case the popup alert the reviewer saying no text f
0 the design appears to be simple
1 it could be better if you tell in which file youll be making those change and if youll create new function or make change in existing function
1 the team ha very well explained the change they are making in the project to achieve the functionality however they have not included any design explanation explicitly they have not described the approach they have come with it might be helpful if they could add the design approach a well in the wiki link so that it easier to understand the code change by having a glance at the design pattern
1 wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like but i did not find any uml diagram or table suggestion the team could have mentioned use case diagram or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality
0 yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team ha achieved in term of the required change
0 yes the design is simple and detailed thus explaining the required change that would be implemented
1 lack of group member the design process is not very clear
0 i loved the overall use of the visualization which aid to the understanding of the whole doc the formatting of the documentation make it really easy to read and understand
1 the team have suggested reasonable change to address the problem statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation
1 explanation is good and easy to understand proposed solution look good a well design and implement a solution that handle github hasnt been explained
0 the diagram are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team
1 i feel the diagram is more complex team could have gone with some usecaseumlcrc diagram
1 the design document coherently describes the project detail including it purpose and design this help to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goal however it could be improved by providing the test case that have been carried out to get to the present state
1 the author have provided a high level solution to the problem statement they have mentioned that they are going to use an api for suggestion detection but have not yet identified one suggestion you can survey on the existing apis and discus about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza this will improve your writeup significantly
1 they explained from their requirement and in their flow that they only need to plan to edit the view so there is no need for a uml
1 the project is complete and sound enough in it approach and the implementation and the test plan ha been well devised and just shy of application even so in their project they lack two section of key note ie one is the project design and the solution approach
1 lack of group member the design process is not very clear
0 test plan for both of their subtasks were present
0 the visual aid have been well put together
1 would be nice to see a sample test plan
0 yes i believe they have included all of the required functionality
0 design is good
0 the test plan briefly mention the scenario the team plan to test they can add more about the test case if possible
1 the explanation and the diagram dont match exactly the explanation say user should be able to see composite and peer review score only after he completes his own review that is not captured in the flow diagram else it is self explanatory
0 basic uml used
0 the author have explained the change made to the system the design flow greatly help to understand the flow of the system
0 explained detail about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
1 there were no such solution listed on the basis of which i could suggest some better solution a couple of test case or issue resolution would have been handful for further suggestion
1 the diagram seems to be good for most of the part one can understand the project by looking at the diagram itself however in one of the instructor flow diagram it given that if the instructor status is pending the instructor will set the limit to that doesnt make sense why would the instructor himselfherself set the limit to isnt this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin suggestion change the yes branch of is pending to loop time or somehow indicate that pending instructor can add only student to an assignment
0 the design document is easy to comprehendhave explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution
1 the author have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller class that they propose to modify so i am not in a position to comment if they are making change in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly the design look precise and there is no need of any additional gem the response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information the team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information or they could possibly use filter to generate only relevant student say under a specific course year at a given university the author have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor addition like code modification file change and uml diagram which can be easily incorporated by the next review
0 yes the figure added to the wiki clearly indicate the change that will be made to each view the column that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable good work
1 document explains the problem well one thing i would like to explained more is how strategy pattern being used will help reduce the code than the amount of code currently present but i guess that will be explained better once the team get to implementing stuff and know a bit more about the design
0 yes design involves google chart api and seems very simple
1 the test plan cover all the report and their creation a well a data to be rendered using the new button added you can try adding edge test case ie the code should not break if data is empty for a report they have not yet posted the complete plan of testing and plan to update a per the progress i would suggest you to take time to define a testing strategy a it will help in tdd which speed up the process highly
1 more explanation around only those two graph are being considered is needed while it early in the project at least what change will be made to a file could have been mentioned
0 the design document doe not include a test plan a testing requirement is very minimal since most change are in view
0 a mentioned in their approach section the team decided on adding some functionality like checkboxes and view i find these change perfect for the problem statement given
1 yes the team seem to have a clear idea a to what must be done and how the result must look it would be helpful if the team gave some insight a to how the composite score formula wa decided a this is the heart of the project
0 the design appears to followed appropriate principle and pattern
0 self explanatory visual change have been added all the change are described via the visual aid
0 well explanation on problem statement uml diagram flow chart given detailed explanation on problem statement
1 no not clear
1 the project is complete and sound enough in it approach and the implementation and the test plan ha been well devised and just shy of application even so in their project they lack two section of key note ie one is the project design and the solution approach
0 yes the design is very simple to understand and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective
0 the project design doc is complete and specifies both issue and prospective solution
0 using google chart is a good idea
0 screenshots are helpful to understand the flow and their work
0 the visualization is great all the flow diagram and required screenshots are in place a required
0 yes only a few file are being modified
0 a very well written document great job
0 i dont think they need any visual aid
1 the author hasnt mentioned any prospective change so this couldnt be looked in to
0 a approach described by the author design appears to be the simplest it is concise and easy to understand
0 yes almost all type of search functionality are covered
1 the author have explained the scope of the project pretty well but a i mentioned in the earlier review a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required one or two sentence would have sufficed
0 most of part are included but they should include more detail in their doc
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation
0 yeah their proposed design includes workflow initial step and subsequent step it wa easy to follow their design their solution appears to be sound
0 yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand
0 the provided test are in depth and will test the change made thoroughly
0 since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive
1 the design document is good which cover every aspect from project purpose to the test case however there are some thing which i found incomplete in the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition of what is meant by self review a the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the ui aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed
1 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work but they are not so lucid so a to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the change in the system
1 since no solution ha been proposed yet this couldnt be reviewed
0 yes the documentation look complete and state the project purpose and solution are stated the project design could be described in more detail
0 yes it doe based on the proposed solution
0 diagram are very clear and well explained
1 the design document ha incorporated test plan but they havent been explained neatly only the skeleton for the test ha been provided theyve should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify
0 yes the design is very simple and explains the change required in a very clear manner
1 need to edit test plan and add more test case
0 there are no diagram present it would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram wa given
0 the design look sound and a lot of improvement have been made after the previous round the design comprises of the list of file modified and created the field to be included in the summary sheet and screenshots showing sample prototype of the summary sheet
1 it doe list out all the functionality but there seem to be no solution for them only a basic layout is present an insight into the solution to be implemented would be suggested
0 the design is pretty straightforward and i am able to get a complete idea of what change the team intend to make
0 yes the change are completely feasible
0 the provided flowchart are visually sufficient to display the change made to the system
0 the document is well made with necessary snapshot
0 the team ha done tremendous job in adding visualization aid they have added application flow diagram and visualized image they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self review and score page this make the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand
0 the design wa not unnecessarily complex it wa a easy a it could be
0 the team ha analysed the existing design principle used in the project and ha appropriately defined the design for the new change which will be made the design look good and easy to implement
0 yes they made detailed explanation about their change
0 the aspect of reproducing the issue are very clearly mentioned and hence test are written briefly which can be easily understood
0 they have include a flow chart to illustrate how the part gon na work
1 the team ha ha listed the file that they propose to change namely the view appviewsresponseresponsehtmlerb and the partial appviewssubmittedcontentselfreviewhtmlerb however they could have described what these file currently do and their purpose in the documentation the author have embedded screenshots of how the ui of the review page will look after the analyze button will be included they have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metric pertaining to a review namely volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric will be generated once the button is clicked
1 they have included the flowchart of the flow of the functionality that is being added which seems to be designed properly and readable also database table whichthey are going to change is depicted they could add class responsibility collaborator card to further illustrate the code change they are about to make
1 the intended change are not stated clearly some solution are also ambiguous the team only said that they would change some file or look more code but they didnt say how they will change
1 the author have explained the scope of the project pretty well but a i mentioned in the earlier review a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required one or two sentence would have sufficed
0 really good visualization provided
1 actually they may include too much info which could be replaced by some link
0 yes the author ha made a great attempt to explain the change by trying to explain the change required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the change were implemented by giving screenshots of the change
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
0 the design appears to be perfect for now except for the flow diagram
0 the design ha a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise
1 the author have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using they have mentioned the file that need to be modified
0 they have specified the file theyll be making the change to and it look good
0 the design is a required following the appropriate pattern
0 the doc seems complete all aspect of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included a usecase diagram will be useful to add
0 the design is concised and clear only make the required change and introduces no duplication
0 given uml diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change
1 all the required part is in their design however maybe you can add a little more detail to your test plan
0 yes
0 yes
0 the design appears to be sound also follows proper design principle eg for making change to nomination and review question inheritance is used inheriting method from question parent class
1 in my opinion they have included the application flow but where in expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing they should include the same in round when they have completed the implementation
1 testing plan is not included however somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the step to reproduce
0 yes the current design look simple and wholesome seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rail internationalization work good job
0 very clear
0 yes according to the given link the design ha incorporated all the requirement and mentioned their test plan a well
1 no visualization or diagram are necessary
0 application flow use case diagram are both very useful to describe the change
1 the current explanation talk only about change in the view it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth
0 yes the system is well designed and the ui look neat a well they have put effort into the ui thinking process
0 the author have mentioned several approach in which these functionality could be implemented their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principle
0 yes the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of
1 the introduction paragraph contains bullet that are identical to e which is surprising the flowchart doe not cover no or negative case and is thus incomplete what is logged in the db and how exactly is start and end time is very ambiguous apart from a mention of merging the data of the detail page on the current report page in the introduction i can not see any further discussion of this particular objective for autosave you could think of using the onunload event of javascript like onload event also settimeout doesnt seem to be an efficient idea since that would make too many number of call from the page i guess you would be sending an ajax request which is asynchronous a next call might be made before a previous call response is handled when you say for each time the reviewer start a review it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database if it doe exist then it will update the
1 the author have not specified any code change a of now so i cant comment on it suggestion you might want to add any api adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future api implementation
1 it seems to me that the implementation of the project ha not started yet hence the exact place in the expertiza code where they plan to make change is missing this should be added in my opinion additionally they have explained very well a to what change need to be done and how they will be done so good job there
1 the modification that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the change that are necessary for the javascript library to work while it is possible to infer the majority of change that will be introduced in this project it would be better if the author elaborated on the implementation of all the view a opposed to discussing only the view submission table
1 the design appears to be a bit complex a it involves interaction with two controller viz reviewmappingcontroller and reportcontroller the change should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing method of these controller nevertheless the design is complete in itself and the author have tried to keep it a modular and clear a possible a very good job here
0 very detailed and precise solution explained thoroughly
0 the author seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project they also seem to follow dry principle while adding and changing code also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code
0 the design incorporates all of the functionality required some edge case are also listed good job
1 the design document contains some extra information such a a whole paragraph about expertiza which i think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part
0 the team ha described change using use case and er diagram to clearly explain the system
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no use of visual aid diagram a of now
1 the author mention gem that they could potentially use but they do not mention where theyd be adding the associated code
0 excellent use of visualization they already had an overall flow chart and this time additional table and uml ha been added best of what ive seen
1 the document show how they will be using the api however since it is initial they have not clearly mentioned the functionality required
0 the project ha great visualization a lot of uml diagram have been included which make the understanding the project easier the uml diagram also clarifies what work is to be done
1 the project design is well presented and solves all issue however testing plan and project purpose are missing you could have given atleast a basic high level overview of testing in the end overall good effort
0 the team have showed what they plan to do in the diagram
1 there are mockups for the final result of the team change however i would like some uml like diagram or some flowchart explaning how a user get to a particular point i dont know if it me or maybe my lack of familiarity with the bacui interface but i found the navigation part a bit difficult to follow
1 the author have made a really good attempt at explaining the change to be made however i feel like few detail could have been added to the previously done work and how they are going to improve it
1 the author clearly explain about the issue and possible solution however there is no description about the technical aspect and what all tool will be used
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no design were added in the documentation
1 yes the design is sound and clear majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm the team proposes to integrate this functionality into expertiza and also improve the response time this project doe not need to incorporate any design pattern a only the view file are altered the project doe not impact the degree to which it is object oriented
0 yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the change made to the system
0 the design follows a clear approach to the functionality avoiding any uncertain flaw
1 change are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more detail
1 the idea to involve instructor because of a requestshour limit may complicate the project another idea would be to update metric with a round robin scheduling of get request
1 the design document contains the project purpose and the change proposed by the team the design flow give an overview of the bar graph that the team plan to generate for selected criterias the introduction section however should largely focus on the project description
0 the team ha added sufficient diagram for the reader
0 since the project is aimed at fixing the issue no design pattern need to be used
0 the design doe not seem that complex the team ha clearly mentioned the issue and the way to go about it
1 the highlevel design which is needed to start with the work look prominent a the project proceeds few intricacy resulting due to design conflict scalability need to be addressed a and when required but the team ha laid out a solid foundation to begin with
0 the change proposed for the class performance is adequate and explains the file to be changed what change from the controller perspective and view perspective no particular suggestion proposed
0 the author have understood the requirement of each report generation clearly they have converted report generation into a single step by providing a dropdown menu for report for this they have used generatereport method the design us a strategy pattern to generate a particular type of report the sub class strategy class use only required subset of class variable and it seems a an efficient design the strategy pattern is a good example of dry principle
0 look like a good test plan and there is a use case diagram their expectation for each of the report strategy is clearly documented in their test plan
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the staggered deadline assignment section
0 very detailed and precise solution explained thoroughly
1 drastic improvement have been made to design doc
1 i think the writing could be done better with more explanation on why the solution mentioned in the last paragraph are taken and what other approach were considered or an explanation of why no alternative exists with regard to design explained in detail in a previous comment
1 the photo included are superb at showing the expected view they can have more or more star if most of the expteriza work for the github metric wa already completed when they made these screen shot do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality picture of your proposed view in action
1 a through testplan is described i do think test case could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand overall look good
0 the document incorporates all the functionality required and explains the same with an ever so accurate reasoning
1 the author have not included any diagram though the purpose and proposed change are understood the team could have mentioned use case diagram or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality
0 the team have suggested reasonable change to address the problem statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation
1 i would the test section incomplete the author have mentioned about test case thats all i think that is not at all sufficient also missing are unit test if any and ui test if any i would have liked mention of more test case both automated a well a ui test that will ensure basic sanity to the system
0 i think the uml diagram can be improved further by adding the class that are related to the use case separately
0 i loved the overall use of the visualization which aid to the understanding of the whole doc the formatting of the documentation make it really easy to read and understand
0 a simple enough explanation ha been provided for the functionality no suggestion
0 they have explained adequately
0 yes their design is very sound and principle and pattern are used appropriately
1 there were mockups of how the analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric however there is no mockup for how the response would be displayedsuggestions i would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big i would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the component of the response from the api or just a few
1 yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand this can be attributed to the fact that their issue are quite simple in nature they could have provided some simple ui mockups of the change
0 design is simple and easy to understand
0 you have a lot of testing scenario which is really good
1 the design appears to be well made however due to lack of more detail i am unable to judge it correctly what change need to be made in the file is not mentioned
0 yes the design appears to be a simple a possible the team ha mentioned what need to be done and how they plan to implement it
1 i think overall it look good however a bit more lowlevel detail may give better insight about such issue
0 the issue have been identified and documented clearly however a little more of explanation is required for the solution proposed for issue they seem to me at a very high level
1 the introduction wa a little confusing a to what this team is going to do rather the objective of the project section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that i wa able to understand what already exists the objective of the project section contains the proposed solution when the proposed solution ought to be a separate section
0 the design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criterion it could incorporate the rubric that the team are planning to target the flow in general doe help to understand the project
1 there are mockups of the end result but there are no other uml diagram there should have been some uml diagram to help explain their design better a well a the flow of the implementation
1 the author have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestion they have now finalized the input and output format however i still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed they have kept it a a black box which make the design quite inadequate it becomes difficult to review if their method class are in the right direction or need any modification they should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm also i have observed that the additional comment box also contains valuable suggestion many of the time please mention if you have considered the additional comment box in your analyze functionality
1 right the project is in it initial phase the overall change proposed by the author are now very unclear about how they are going to work
1 it included a proper test plan there wa no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but author have added it in the second round which made the design document complete
1 right the project is in it initial phase the overall change proposed by the author are now very unclear about how they are going to work
0 lot of great visualization are provided that outline a good amount of detail
1 again it fine i dont understand the change too well but i also dont understand mvc and expertiza very well either but maybe they could have tried harder i do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of expertiza
0 their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the popup text message a json and displaying suggestion metric for the review segment a block of review a comment box try to include test case where a review message is absent ie the code should not break for empty review segment include a test case where review segment ha a suggestion and test if the output say suggestion present include a negative test case for the the suggestion where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer and test that the output say suggestion absent
1 the proposed solution sound good they havent really mentioned the change in turn of programmer language i couldnt visualize how are they going to make change they have mentioned few htmlerb file but i think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature i think the team could have been more precise in their approach for example they could have included what all new method they need to add or modify the existing one
0 a simple enough explanation ha been provided for the functionality no suggestion
0 the test plan is pretty good and it ha both ui test and automated test
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
1 the author ha not suggested any change a of now
1 using a strategy pattern to solve this problem is one of the simplest approach according to me and team ha selected the same thing only thing i would suggest the team is to be carefull when separating the class a it might have some unintended side affect
0 the team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the webaudio api by implementing missing piece of incomplete node type oscillatornode along with entire missing node constantsourcenode stereopannernode iirfilternode
0 the test plan are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into step such a presteps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve indepth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
0 yes i think so
1 the have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualization the could have added lofi ui card to depict change to view which will help them visualize the change and also help instructor in suggesting improvement at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code change in latter stage of the project
1 testing plan not included
0 yes the current design look simple and wholesome seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rail internationalization work good job
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality
0 yes
1 got confused in between about the proposed solution
0 the necessary visual input to aid explanation are present
0 yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which give a very clear picture of how the change are going to be implemented and which functionality would be witnessing the change also a they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more
1 yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principle and pattern fell the team could have explained in more detail
1 the test plan is present it is broken down into separate section for each of the five issue each section is further broken down into a manual and automated testing part while the section for manual testing are comprehensive the section for automated test are too general and do not provide a clear vision for what type of change are going to be introduced i would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the test for example specifying which spec file will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize rspec
0 they will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructor more effectively
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no use of visual aid diagram a of now
1 the team ha done a good job in listing down the project requirement and design however i suggest the testing plan be improved in place of giving step on how a reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write test for the functionality added for example list down a dummy set of data in any one report view mention how they would like to write a test for this say using capybara and then how to corroborate the result from the view
0 the project consists of making a search function to select specific user assignment etc using some criterion so theyre creating a search functionality for individual model
0 the team ha done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage they have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project
0 screenshots are helpful to understand the flow and their work
0 the test plan added is just a basic case and a the change are just some calculation to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project
0 design document contains all the functionality required
0 yes design appears to be sound
1 no plan or uml design is given
1 though the pull request ha been passed but the writeup doe not explain the detail of the implementation like what sorting algorithm the team ha implemented using jquery etc the design part of the writeup is very hollow and need further refinement
0 diagram are very clear and well explained
1 yes the team intends to use gradecontroller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality the idea to involve instructor because of a requestshour limit may complicate the project another idea would be to update metric with a round robin scheduling of get request
1 the author do not have a section for proposed change hence it is not completely clear which change they are proposing and which change are already existing
0 yes all change are incorporated and explained well
1 in my opinion they have included the application flow but where in expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing they should include the same in round when they have completed the implementation
1 the test plan is complete and cover all intended functionality they have also provided all necessary step to test the functionality good documentation on test plan a clientside change using script is added a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
0 not much ha been talked about the method to be added but the file specified seems right
0 well they have mentioned what need to be done what change have to be implemented
1 no plan provided can not comment
0 yes they have added mock ui screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do
0 proper use case diagram have been added for next submission team can add uml diagram
1 the team ha attached a bar chart for visualization which help in understanding their purpose suggestion more visual aid could have been added the stacked bar chart a mentioned earlier more mockups could have been added
0 yes the required change for the review is explained clearly the design for each required change is also explained in depth now
0 the change are very well documented for each issue what are the file that need to be changed is mentioned appropriately the overall design look efficient and avoids any duplication good job
0 the design document appears to be concise in it representation according to the task specified and proposal described the design appears simple to be executed
1 the need for two translation apis wa not justified
1 good work but i find following missing for completeness a table of content b current design and proposed change c integration of new feature in design d use case diagram e test plan
1 the screenshots of the expected result and the uml diagram are good but the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more userfriendly the uml diagram can be better if it designed a a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram which simply state how the reader is to approach this or it could be better if we have both
0 yes the design appears to be simple
1 the team ha done a good job in listing down the project requirement and design however i suggest the testing plan be improved in place of giving step on how a reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write test for the functionality added for example list down a dummy set of data in any one report view mention how they would like to write a test for this say using capybara and then how to corroborate the result from the view
0 based on the mockups it seems like the design will fit in well with th expertiza system id like to see more professional mockups or description of the new uis but i understand that might not be feasible yet
0 the visualization seem to be complete the team ha included an application flow diagram a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look so in my opinion good job done
0 html file require change i dont think it will affect anything
1 the screen mockups were very nice good job i would like to see a uml diagram for the implementation ie how a reference to a static string in a view eventually map to the correct yaml file that would make the design more specific and clear
1 yes author have done well to explain the change being done in the project i think i wish they would have added is the detail of language they are supporting also they do mention that they will add extra column to language table they could have pasted the new schema in the doc
1 how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use
0 yes the author ha explained the adequately the change to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student
1 i do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system the team also ha mentioned about the api that they will use enough effort have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it suggestion no information about the method that will be implemented ha been given in the design document availability of such info would have been helpful
0 the design data includes most of the important information required to understand the team plan
1 documentation is proper team could have added db table a well in the design doc
1 the team ha included screenshots of the review ui the first one depicts the existing look and the nd one show that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student ha reviewed and also display a popup message showing the result of suggestion metric like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric the team ha also shown the user story in connextra format and also described to scenario one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input the team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow char uml diagram for use case or sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenario they plan to implement
1 the test plan is present it consists of a set of functional test described for each of the five view i would suggest elaborating on the technical side of test for example specifying which spec file will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize rspec moreover it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional test
0 did not find much info on the design
0 no test are required for the project a stated
0 this project is not very difficult so they dont need to follow some principle or pattern
1 the test plan seems to be fine it basically outline all the functionality that the team will test the different case the team will test is also outlined though not many i guess there will be more test case to be added once the project is on the roll
1 the doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project seems like the team still need time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issue identified
1 a the design document section is missing i can not review the quality of their proposed design
1 they list the file to be changed for the final stage of the project but the description of what will be changed is still lacking id love to see screenshots of added code or an explanation of what is and is not needed
0 the aspect of reproducing the issue are very clearly mentioned and hence test are written briefly which can be easily understood
0 yes the presence of use case diagram and flow chart explaining the work flow is good it would be nice if there were more uml diagram such a sequence so show various class interaction presence of mockup screen is good that help in understanding what is being implemented it would have been good if the author put in more detail about the validation that that propose in the system
1 the problem statement are much detailed but they could be more concise the test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation
0 the document is quite comprehensive in it description of the design proposal
0 the design they have right now look good to me it doe not have any issue
0 no change proposed
0 yes the author ha explained the scope of the project very clearly and ha specified the change to be made in the project to accomplish the goal
0 confronted with a tricky problem in creating link between different assignment across semester to aggregate the review i wa really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature
1 the introduction wa a little confusing a to what this team is going to do rather the objective of the project section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that i wa able to understand what already exists the objective of the project section contains the proposed solution when the proposed solution ought to be a separate section
0 documentation is proper team could have added db table a well in the design doc
0 from the reason provided for choosing the google chart tool and it effectiveness it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed
1 the project goal are stated in a simple and precise manner the design document is readable and easy to understand from they have provided the reader with the background which state the need to do the refactoring they can include or add file name which they are about to change
0 no complex design only few place need to add functionality and they all very similar
1 the author have shown screenshots of example output a a part of visualization this show the original page the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to hindi though this visualization display the final output there is no visualization that show the design and implementation of this new feature
0 yes the author have significantly improved the writeup and very adequately explained the change that theyve made
1 document is explained well with clear understanding of the issue problem statement design plan is explained well team can work on adding test plan a well a well diagram and screenshots to make the document more explanatory
1 the design appears to be simple however any code modification is not mentioned yet a work project might not have started so far it would be nice if a list of file to be modified were added
0 they have used a use case diagram to explain flow i found it quite understandable and all the step are clearly drawn out in the diagram it clearly explains the step required to approach a situation
1 no test plan is included they can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope
0 yes i believe so they discus what they need to track during a review and what they need display after a review is complete
0 author have explained well the change to be made in the system
1 the project goal are stated in a simple and precise manner the design document is readable and easy to understand from they have provided the reader with the background which state the need to do the refactoring they can include or add file name which they are about to change
1 the change to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document the filter by which the data need to be curated have also been stated however it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specific
1 the explanation are done well but they could be more thorough why is the internationalization api and google translate needed also will you use a script to edit the view how would you do that it seems like too much work to do manually
0 the document explains what wa asked for
1 there is no mention of testing also code change related detail have not been included otherwise the document is very good
1 uml diagram are not provided please add it
0 the author adequately explained the change they plan to make
1 no uml diagram or screenshots have been included currently
0 yes the author have adaquately explained the change to be made in the system
0 screenshots and visual ques are provided to the user
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation flowchart and mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change no suggestion required
1 the document doe not explain the reason behind creating the new class reportstrategy
1 unfortunately no visual aid are provided in the design i would suggest providing the simplified uml diagram that doe not necessarily capture all of the class that interact with the one that will be modified by the team but the one that the team find will be most relevant to the reader
0 nothing specified
1 test are well covered however i dont see how the nicely constructed use case diagram is appropriate to be placed in the test plan section
1 did not find much info on the design
1 while i understand conceptually i dont believe they explained their change in appropriate detail simply describing additional column and a flow chart miss the biggest part of these change which is user experience how will window popup what will the new data look like after a review is complete
0 the design seems to be following dry principle
1 the design appears to be a bit complex a it involves interaction with two controller viz reviewmappingcontroller and reportcontroller the change should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing method of these controller nevertheless the design is complete in itself and the author have tried to keep it a modular and clear a possible a very good job here
0 the design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the button tray from the existing ui the button when clicked must bring a menu of additional report this functionality should consider the mapping to the reviewmapping controller file that will implement the given feature
1 while i understand conceptually i dont believe they explained their change in appropriate detail simply describing additional column and a flow chart miss the biggest part of these change which is user experience how will window popup what will the new data look like after a review is complete
0 yes the design doc cover all of the required functionality
0 yes the team ha added a test plan after the first review the test plan seems to cover the major portion of the change planned
1 did not find much info on the design
0 while im awaiting to receive the detail which are pending on the implementation i feel the general nature of the change is wellexplained
1 no plan or uml design is given
1 the author hasnt mentioned any prospective change so this couldnt be looked in to
1 yes the design includes a very good test plan the test are deep and detailed and completely test the functionality but i think it could be better following the dry principle if the tester dont need to log in a administrator every time
1 a stated above the team ha not explained any design pattern they are following however they have mentioned all the code change they are making for this functionality implementation the code snippet they have included is very useful to understand the exact code change they are making and the file which are getting impacted this would help the future developer to understand the code in a simple manner
0 it wa weird that two of the bug they were assigned dont exist but thats not the team fault
1 yes the design incorporated all functionality required but more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show
0 using google chart is a good idea
0 yes the test plan is includedi think the test will cover all scenario
0 the document is clearly and neatly written all the necessary section are present with good explanation
1 the design seems to be sound there are a lot of mention of which file will be modified however a i said in the previous round there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the change they will make currently will change the database suggestion team could mention what table are present in the database of the bacui project i believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewer are working on expertiza project and have no knowledge of bacui project at the very least the team could mention which table the project will be interacting with along with their structure
0 the design wa well explained in this design doc
0 in my view they are simple and clear
0 i understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system
1 it state the internal jquery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting again more detail on implementation are required to be documented to ass the quality of the solution
0 adequate information given on implementing the solution flow chart are impressive
0 the team ha done tremendous job in the test plan they have already implemented the test case and given the path to run it
1 yes a good test plan is also included
1 there is no test plan for this project it could be difficult to test the exact time returned however it would be a good idea to test that the report page in fact show the statistic
0 all the proposed change look like exactly what need to be implemented in this project
1 the author have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategy using a uml diagram the could add crc card or use case or the application flow diagram which will aide in the report presentation
0 the change proposed for the class performance is adequate and explains the file to be changed what change from the controller perspective and view perspective no particular suggestion proposed
0 the design seems appropriate to the issue at hand
0 the author have considerably improved on the document uml diagram a requested have been added
1 the design seems to follow appropriate principle and pattern it is simple and clearly explains what need to be done and where the change will be made suggestion addition of screen mockups to document will help reviewer a lot
1 the author have taken effort to identify the right place for making the identified change it seems that they have already done some change suggestion i feel that the proposed change on a high level you might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your change be like you might also consider adding use case for your change
1 the design document ha mentioned the issue which need to be fixed but why these issue are occurring and what will the solution be is missing
0 mainly need html file to be changed and they have mentioned them which look good
0 the test are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
1 design document explains the entire project flow very well the objectivesgoals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in futurethe flowchart explains the functionality very well overall the doc is easy to understand suggestion team should include test plan in the doc
1 the change proposed are quite understandable however i would suggest them to clearly provide a clear path how they are going to reach their result the initial planning is quite appreciable though
0 they have covered all the test plan along with detailed step
0 good explanation easy to follow
0 flowchart are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation
1 yes design seems fit more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented
1 the team implementation of a uml diagram seems to be a good way of representing the change plannedthe diagram could have been detailed with regard to the class that are being added and modified there should be attribute of each class then the method that are added or changed with the type of input to these method and return type of these method
1 this seems complete to me they have the introduction with a purpose and problem a ui mockup and use case it doe seem odd that the use case are listed in the test plan
1 the diagram seems to be good for most of the part one can understand the project by looking at the diagram itself however in one of the instructor flow diagram it given that if the instructor status is pending the instructor will set the limit to that doesnt make sense why would the instructor himselfherself set the limit to isnt this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin suggestion change the yes branch of is pending to loop time or somehow indicate that pending instructor can add only student to an assignment
0 the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team ha also included all the change that will be made to achieve the desired result great work
0 the team ha provided flowchart which make it easier to understand their solution the provided diagram seem enough for the reader to understand the solution
0 yes
0 the change are apt and easy to follow it make sense
1 no visual aid have been provided by the author
1 mostly yes but the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagram
1 diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document
1 change could be explained in detail i think that is missing a bit
0 the design doc is complete all the relevant section have been added
0 the change proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output
0 it wa weird that two of the bug they were assigned dont exist but thats not the team fault
0 the application plan diagram ha been shown it distinguishes between instructor and student
0 looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion and low coupling it good that all the change are restricted to the routesrb and configlocales file so that the resulting change wont be messy and ruin the rest of the system also this help in refactoring if needed in the future a there will be limited number of file to be changed
1 the explanation of each of the issue in detail is done very well but it doe seem to be complicated unless file to be modified and solution are read
0 the visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to expertiza
0 the diagram in the wiki clearly describe the flow for proposed change to the system we can clearly decipher from the diagram what the intended functionality is good job
0 proposed change need more explanation at the file and system specifically what file need to be changed and how
0 design look well thought out
0 the design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principle a far a i am concerned and a mentioned earlier i would again like to point out that the proposed plan section ha been handled really well
0 the design is simple
1 there no visual aid i think other than a screenshot of a finalized result possible a workflow diagram will also be useful the work design
0 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the implementation section
0 the design is simple although the er diagram take a little time to decipher since it is quite big
0 the design is a required following the appropriate pattern
1 the project purpose and possible solution are clearly described in this design doc however the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solution also there is no testing plan
0 yes it doe based on the proposed solution
0 no plan or uml design is given
0 the explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project all the step piece up the project completely no suggestion
0 the design incorporates all the basic functionality
0 all function required are stated in the design document which include search for user assignment questionnaire and review
0 it not a great explanation
1 more or le an a for effort but i dont know if the uml is fine with so little in it because we dont care about what those class do or if we should care and there should be more about those class and their state and behavior
0 no uml diagram
0 no complex design only few place need to add functionality and they all very similar
0 very simple and clear
0 there were mockups of the final result of the project however there were no uml diagram i think the uml diagram are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document maybe they could have done a mockup of how some of the other view would have looked like once the language ha changed especially the page with flash message if any currently they have just shown the proposed change on the page where the instructor will change the language
1 the design appears to be sound for most part of it the linking between the different section seems appropriate the only issue i have is with the mockup in the design detail second change mockup number i think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day i feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information becausei it is common knowledge that many student do not begin project until a few daysweeks would have passed since the assignment is posted so that would leave the initial few day of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to showii the duration of each project varies from project to project assignment had a duration of about day this would mean that there would be about bar chart for each day which would be quite difficult for the tainstructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other team they need to evaluate
0 the explanation is decent and comprehensible
1 the doc is very well written it like a blueprint to the project really appreciate the team effort
0 the design feel simple and not much different from the one i saw in round in my perspective because i have already reviewed the project in the previous round but to a new reviewer it might not be that direct at first a they need to understand the base of the project and the first phase of implementation which is covered in the wiki document of the previous project
0 yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
0 yes they do explain everything the er diagram use case diagram relevant table explain everything
0 from the previous stage the team ha added the use case diagram that efficiently describes the actor involved in the process also since a new controller is proposed it wa essential to identify the role of the instructor
0 this their design is very simple and clear
0 yes they look well written and easy to follow with all the visual aid
0 change are explained but are not very descriptive the document is not much changed since the last submission
0 i dont think they need any visual aid
1 no umls given
0 they author have explained it well they have also mentioned which gem eg oktokit ruby toolkit for github api that they plan on using
0 clearly defined uml
0 the design doc includes the test plan which cover all the change that will be made
1 i feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge case
1 issue uml diagram is too high level so it doe not provide enough detail rest all diagram follow the standard and are easy to understand
0 it appears to be sound
0 the document contains a uml use case diagram that analyze the system requirement and describes the actor involved and the relationship between them it help to understand the overview of the project detail however it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the expected flow section that give more clarity about the sequence of action the flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the task performed by the actor in a serial order
1 the project writeup is not complete at this moment a there are a lot of thing missing like what the team plan to do and what concretey are it testing technique it only mention the problem statement and an overview of testing
1 the have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualization the could have added lofi ui card to depict change to view which will help them visualize the change and also help instructor in suggesting improvement at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code change in latter stage of the project
1 the documentation covered almost everything from project purpose design flow a well a some info on what file will be changed in the project suggestion i feel that the test plan wa a bit vague some more detail should have been provided for example what all feature will be tested or maybe some info about edge case and different scenario that will be covered
1 the design includes test planon the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionality but nothing mentioned on how they will write
0 yes the test plan look good it cover all the functionality
0 yes the functionality is explained
0 the design seems to be very simple i think the team ha avoided unnecessary complication and are doing minimal change to existing system to solve issue given to them
0 the design doc includes the test plan which cover change in the functionality
0 the document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow they have explained each and everything stepwise
0 yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team ha achieved in term of the required change
0 they will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructor more effectively
0 the design document is really well written it clearly describes what need to be done how it need to be done and what code change need to be made the file and table affected are clearly listed
1 yes the functionality are present it would have been good if the issue were listed sequentially following it solution
1 the author have included a uml diagram which explains a flow of the diagram the document doe not strike a balance in the use of visualization it lack at illustrating the change using appropriate usecases mockup screen to show the expected change a opposed to the current scenario the mockup screen can include sorted value of the field whose header you clicked upon also there is no need of other visualization aid such a class diagram a the modification are limited to view
0 really good visualization provided
0 the change proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output
0 diagram is added
1 the diagram have been enlarged and are now visible good improvement however i still feel that computer made mockups would have looked cleaner
0 yes they have a complete design for testing and include all the case they need to test
0 impressive writeup flowchart and uml diagram are wellexplained detailed explanation of problem statement and solution to be implemented
0 yes detailed ui mockups were very impressive the use case diagram and explanation are well written
0 the author have understood the requirement of each report generation clearly they have converted report generation into a single step by providing a dropdown menu for report for this they have used generatereport method the design us a strategy pattern to generate a particular type of report the sub class strategy class use only required subset of class variable and it seems a an efficient design the strategy pattern is a good example of dry principle
0 the proposed design is simple and no extra change are being proposed
1 yes the author are using already existing gem for the implementation i would have liked to see a section on caching if any rest the solution proposed look simple and straightforward and look that it will easily integrate into the current system
0 good job on ui and test case kindly add uml diagram
1 the design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criterion it could incorporate the rubric that the team are planning to target the flow in general doe help to understand the project
0 the team ha included test plan in connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenario one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text no more test case can be added to check if the team part in the project is implemented well some test case scenario that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm for example to detect review response that generate the generalized suggestion for all the project can be included
0 really good visualization provided
0 the explanation given are succinct and clear the flow of implementation seems very clear however a mentioned before i would like more detail on the api
0 the use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the change made to the system
1 search questionnaire and search review dont have detailed explanation of what should be done
1 the team state all the problem included in this project and provide the solution for them however the author didnt provide enough introduction about what the project is the problem wa not explained clear enough and tough to understand no test plan provided
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 yes
0 test plan outline the functionality that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the change
1 few information is missing like specification on nlp and how exactly the implementation would be idea is fine but add more detail to it
0 the design doe include test plan and plan to test the functionality
0 the explanation is easy to follow i am able to get a complete idea of what change the team intend to make
0 a lot of visuals very helpful when viewer walk through the design
1 class diagram are missing class diagram are missing first flow diagram look perfect second need some modification the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to this should have been done before only you should add a step to perform a check to see if the total student count is crossing the allowed limit if yes then dont add this new student and show some proper error message to the user if no then add the student
1 it would have been better if some screenshots and uml diagram wa added to the design doc to better explain the functionality
1 a such the project description doe not ask for any visualization but visualization in term of uml diagram or a crc card would have been a helpful way to make the description better
0 yes the design is simple and feasible
0 the design is apt following the principle and are selfexplanatory
1 i think technical design lack detail the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work where will the string be kept what are the effective change required across the project test plan should have more test
0 yes the author have adaquately explained the change to be made in the system
1 the design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly
1 they might like to elaborate more on how they plan to use the hash of student to retrieve the specific information of the assignment for eg what model will you be using to query the db
0 yes the proposed change and intended output is clearly mentioned in the design document
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand i can easily know what they will do through their doc
1 explanation is good and easy to understand proposed solution look good a well design and implement a solution that handle github hasnt been explained
0 yes
0 the document enlisted the crucial aspect of the project in the first stage the team ha made improvement in this stage by including a test plan section that list the set of test case to deal with the retrieval issue and plan on including a new controller for the next stage
0 great flowchart it help to see all the possible scenario in a compact manner
1 the change proposed by the team have been specified in detail providing general requirement about each goal but it doe not make any specific of the code that could help to infer the proposal with the functionality
0 super legit use case diagram some of their picture even had colour i liked that
0 the given flowchart describes the flow of the project and how the implemented system will work
0 yes functional test with scenario provided
0 yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
0 yes it doe they have explained the propose solution a well for each issue
1 the design isnt extremely simple to understand at first glance but given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated the team ha made effort to make it a clear a possible
1 the test plan ha covered test case for testing functionality of sorting submission table and review mapping per field they can also include test plan for the edge case of the system like the code should not break when the submission table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying no entry to be sorted in this way try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage this will make your code more rigid
1 a mentioned earlier the flowchart and simple er diagram are helpful but i believe these change would benefit greatly from having lowfi sketch and actor diagram instead of flowchart
1 unfortunately the team ha missed out on adding any visual aid to the document i would suggest that where you list all the column name which would be sorted in each view also add a screenshot of how that view look at the present moment and a lowfi sketch of how the view would look after the change have been implemented
0 the test design includes both controller a well a feature test the team ha also made an effort by putting up video link of the running of test
1 the overall quality of the explanation are good but they should include more detail about their design which may not be easy to understand
0 the project involves refactoring of the review mapping controller and the author have proposed a clear action plan they have added a bvery detailed testing plan and also a detailed uml diagram the author have updated their uml diagram and also updated their testing plan after the first submission
1 the doc contains almost everything in term of design except for the test plan you might want to add a test plan right away to go for a testdriven development
0 the design seems to be following the appropriate principle and us the appropriate guideline they usecase diagram mention each actor and the role associated
0 yes the design is simple and clear the task is to integrate a web service which return a result in json format
0 the chart and diagram are well done and help explain how the code will work
1 everything look great you can add test plan for this a it a big change in functionality
1 the explanation for change are just an overview of what need to be done and doe not focus on the change to be made in the file
0 the project design doc is complete and specifies both issue and prospective solution
1 the planned design look complicated a there is a lot of data and variable transfer between class this could have been simplified a bit
1 the documentation is somewhat ambiguous
0 since it is a mozilla project testing is not necessary but the previous design documentation doe touch upon the specific of testing how an offscreencanvas is rendered
0 yes the team added visual aid like uml diagram screen shot code snippet to clearly describe the change to be made to the system well done
0 the design doc clearly explains the project purpose project design and the test plan
0 the explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objective
1 nice mockup for another language it is clean the menu bar for translated language screen is still in english i assume it is just a careless mistake when make the mockup
0 the document clearly specifies the problem statement it seems good enough they have mentioned the api they are planning to use a well a the file to be modified however i would like more detail on this api and how they plan to integrate it into their project
1 the technical change required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly this make it difficult to understand the problem statement properly some highlevel domain knowledge and requirement background will be helpful
1 the document mention the detailed test case that need to be done but not how it will be done
0 the design contains all of the functionality that required
0 the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principle
0 the design document incorporated all the functionality that the project is supposed to be implementing no suggestion
0 excellent diagram and ui mock ups
0 the expected outcome of the project have been clearly explained and requirement well understood
0 the document explains what wa asked for
0 the design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view
1 the team ha included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenario that will be tested after the implementation how the team will be testing it what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan how an end user can test the endto end requirement should also be a part of the design
0 the design seems to be precise the description of the change are provided in detailthe team also ha mentioned about the api that they will use they have clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use enough effort have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it
1 the team ha used screenshots to explain their plan but havent used any diagram like uml or flowchart to describe their flow
0 yes they made detailed explanation about their change
0 the diagram are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team
0 they team ha done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagram they have created uml diagram which depicts the flow of the admin and student along with other actor a mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which make it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirement in the expertiza system
0 they have worked on their weak point earlier their solution doe not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
1 the purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined the project design seems to be barely mentioned there have been mention of the word api but not which one so reading the doc i have no clue of how they are going to implement this however i do know the file that they are going to modify the test plan ha been written in the form of cucumber user story i am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach
0 enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement ha been given overall explanation is good
0 yes the document includes a test plan there wa no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionality
0 this team did not require any test
1 these change seem to be appropriate for the objective they have only a small set of file are being changed and the functionality is isolated well my only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helper or utility for time tracking
1 the testing plan is not proper though the document is nicely presented it doe not concentrate on all area i would suggest to systematically describe each step
0 the explanation provided by the author seems to be good they have referred the rail internationalization api guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support they have mentioned the different element that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally in addition they have also added mockups to visually represent this information
1 they have test plan but i dont think they include test in it they just put some example about how to run their code
0 change are well explained with good visual aid
1 test are given at a very high level and need to be described properly
0 the design proposes solution for all the issue every issue is well described and flow diagram are provided for the solution
1 the team ha very well explained the change they are making in the project to achieve the functionality however they have not included any design explanation explicitly they have not described the approach they have come with it might be helpful if they could add the design approach a well in the wiki link so that it easier to understand the code change by having a glance at the design pattern
1 the team ha not included any additional diagram apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage the flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of action that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criterion set
1 i think the diagram shown include where you intend to add the metric but not how all the metric will be incorporated in the next phase make sure to include detail for each of these total number of commits number of file changed line of code added line of code modified line of code deleted locs that survived until final submission exclude from mvp due to the complexity and lower priority
0 test can be made more exhaustive for now it look like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested a well
1 there is a test plan the test are deep and detailed however the current test plan is not enough to test the functionality they are just unit test it should be added with a test that directed test whether the instructor can do the same kind of review a the student from the user s perspective for example log in do the review etc
1 the design is sound because it ha plan of file modification of implemented solution and very detailed testing plan the dry principle might not be well followed since in each testing the tester need to log in a a superadministrator again and there are five testing
1 design is informative but too detailed one uml would have been apt
0 the author have explained the functionality and the change to be made to the project in depth
0 yes the given flowchart describes the sequence of event and how the application behaves in response to those event
1 the mockups do explain where the team intends to add the analyze button it however make no explanation of where the analysis will be shown
0 the team ha included all the issue a stated in the project description google doc the team ha provided solution for all these issue a well the solution are descriptive and easy to follow
0 no visualization required for this project
0 everything is explained well and easy to understand
1 they have very well stated of about the purpose of their project they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graph they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor they have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but havent specified which file need to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete
0 the design appears to be specific to the requirement for this they have used a uml design which basically explains the flow of the usecase they have not used any principle or design pattern however there doe not seem a need to use any a their change are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using jquery a per the document the design doe not make any redundant change or unnecessary change to the code thus they have done a good job by optimizing the change
1 the author have described the change to be made however these are very abstract and require some technical depth
0 the author have explained the change in depth and with proper detail
0 for now the design proposed look perfect
0 team have explained the problemsteps to reproduce are really very clear solution part could have been explained better overall it a good work
0 the design doc is well written and the point to be completed are clearly expressed
0 no not all but major of all functionality
0 this wa excellently specific and succinct very nice work
1 the team ha included all the detail required to implement the given requirement the wiki ha complete detail related to requirement analysis of current design and change required to achieve the required functionality overall great job the team did a great work in analyzing the issue and designing solution for the issue the ui mock ups are included for all the issue which make the document very easy to understand
0 yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood
0 i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who ha a test plan like this
0 the use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the change made to the system
0 the proposed refactoring change seem to follow good ruby principle and also look dry they haven t mentioned any pattern a such but overall the design document look neat and very well written
1 yes the design includes a test plan it s adequate to test all functionality of the newly introduced controller it doesnt talk in detail about the way the system is to be tested and what is the exact outcome to be verified
1 they have test plan part but not including specific plan
1 no diagram have been mentioned and they have said that they would implement a diagram in the final design doc and thus that part of the project ha been left in the air no diagram present no conventional flow since no diagram present not only no high level but no diagram are are even abstractly specified
1 the problem statement and implementation approach are very clearly explained with screenshots missing item test plan uml diagram
0 yes they made detailed explanation about their change
0 sound so many diagram
0 the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the wiki the wiki contains mock visualization which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do the design flow a a flow chart add to the ease of understanding the test plan explains about the technology that they are planning to use for testing suggestion the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technology to be used for a particular part of code for ed we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graph output the visualization correctly if the sum id being counted to of the class participation etc the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding
0 i like the part where the peer review ha been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score
0 good work on adding uml diagram now the problem is very well explained
0 the design doc is completed and give exact information on what author are gon na do
0 the author have improved the part of the document that describes the interaction between html and javascript part since the st round while this assignment doe not require an extensive discussion about the design principle or pattern it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic
0 the team ha incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact report and function to be removed out of reviewmappingcontrollerrb along with the design pattern to be followedstrategy in this case
0 the design seems pretty accurate the schema of the database table record all the necessary detail with reasonable granularity
1 i feel that the test section is in adequate the user have only listed scenario with no detail on how to implement that also missing are detailed step on how to execute the test if required
0 a test plan is included in this design doc
0 the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
0 yes the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionality a stated in the problem statement
0 the design is a simple a possible
1 this is the only place i found the author could improve there is no mention of the actual file that need to be modified they have detailed out the change that they propose but no mention of actual file and the code change it would be further increase the clarity of the solution if you could include that too
1 they have explained their implementation through ui mockups well they are not quite understandable but for the first submission this could work
1 i think technical design lack detail the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work where will the string be kept what are the effective change required across the project test plan should have more test
0 yes
1 the mock uis are well thought of and make navigation easier a couple of suggestion can add another mock ui showing the drop down some type of report may not exist if the drop down option are hardcoded selecting an option might lead to a page with no content this might be an existing issue i suspect for every option you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down
1 more effort should be expended on the design the solution is too highend abstract also some screenshots being added would be a lot more helpful and addressing the above issue will also increase the readability
0 i liked the visualization used this time around they have certainly improved from the last time i liked the overall used of high and low level visualisation provided
1 test plan are present but have not explained in detail a brief description of the use case with the test plan and rspec would be perfect
0 yes the team ha added a test plan after the first review the test plan seems to cover the major portion of the change planned
1 i think the file that the author plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate a to the smell of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code so far though the design seems sound there have however been no mention of the existence of any gem i think the author should explore that avenue a well a that would probably simplify their task for example i found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrase into positive negative and neutral i think this is something the author can look into
1 the functionality need to be explained a bit more
1 just overview is presented which is explained properly the technical design is not explained in depth
0 yes it cover all the functionality
0 design doc contains everything in clear explanation
0 the explainations are succinct the description in technical design section and beforeafter image clearly show what the project intends to do
0 with er diagram and database detail the design look good
0 ui enhancement are provided here
0 use of flowchart and step by step explanation simplified their solution it wa easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple
1 there are no diagram present it would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram wa given
1 diagram are used from previous project no diagram explaining newer functionality
0 only a single uml diagram is present but id have appreciated a couple of flow chart to accompany the expected flow
1 uml diagram are not provided please add it
1 they didnt add the code change detail or the file in which they might work thats still fine a those detail can be filled once the implementation is done
0 great use of mock ups really appreciate it
0 implemented major of them
1 no visual aid have been provided by the author
1 the team ha mentioned all the file that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed change the team could also document the change that are being made to individual code file stating the change done using code snippet and the reason why the change are being made also they can talk about what design pattern principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed the team could also use crc card to depict the proposed code change this will not only help reader understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team member and fast tracking the completion of project
1 team have explained the problemsteps to reproduce are really very clear solution part could have been explained better overall it a good work
0 the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualization
0 the proposed change match existing expertiza guideline well
1 no code is mentioned to be checked
0 the team ha included a lot of visual aid which complement the document making it a lot easier to understand great work with the ui mockups project design uml diagram
0 yes the team ha used flowchart and diagram which clearly describe the change to be made to the system
1 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work but they are not so lucid so a to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the change in the system
1 several test are listed and described i would suggest adding more detail for each test a there is some vagueness a to what each described action entail
0 yes the flow diagram and graph plot help to understand the change and it implication the diagram clearly describe the change approach followed
0 the design is sound because it ha plan of file modification of implemented solution and very detailed testing plan the dry principle might not be well followed since in each testing the tester need to log in a a superadministrator again and there are five testing
0 even though few test case have been provided i feel like it could have been more detailed with the step involved in the testing
0 yes the design is a simple a it can be the current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots and the change are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table a mockup screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand however reading the material is sufficient a well the change are not complex a they interact with a single view at a time the tablesorter function is also called for each view eg viewsubmissions layout
0 the design is concise and clear they have added reference image of how the system would look after their change which properly show the expected implementation result
0 explained very well
0 a testplan that cover the entire functionality ha been devised it seems sufficient to test the change
1 the author havent given the file to be modified or the change they are going to do to the system
0 yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
0 clean flow chart
1 could not find any explanation regarding the change proposed
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 the change necessary are explicitly outlined though more description a to why certain file need to be modified would be nice to have
1 no uml diagram present can create a simple use case diagram to indicate the flow of the solution
0 the use case appear to offer a quality general test approach to see if their design doe what it should
1 the uml and flow chart used by the team are good but can be made more clear and appealing
1 i feel that the test section is in adequate the user have only listed scenario with no detail on how to implement that also missing are detailed step on how to execute the test if required
0 yep they have good structure to show what and how they gon na do with the project
1 the design is well explained need clarification on below how will this github metric will be used to grade the student so how will the final mark for a particular be calculated using the data from github
0 the proposed solution would be the best approach to tackle the issue in my opinion they would not make the code smelly or complicated
1 the design cover all tthe major aspect well i feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way
0 yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
0 yes the given flowchart describes the sequence of event and how the application behaves in response to those event
0 the design seems pretty accurate the schema of the database table record all the necessary detail with reasonable granularity
0 it included a proper test plan there wa no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but author have added it in the second round which made the design document complete
0 the design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code change
0 the design is concise and clear
1 the document is very wellwritten just the test plan is missing
0 yes the design is a simple a possible however they have only described the proposed design they could have provided simple mock ups or sample
0 a very well written document great job
0 this team did not require any test
1 yes the design is appropriate it would be better if the author list the pattern they are going to use
0 yes the document includes a test plan there wa no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionality
0 author have a clear idea of what detail need to be included to make the audience understand the purpose of the project the design document is sufficient to get the basic idea and implementation
0 the design sound very reasonable
1 it could be better if you tell in which file youll be making those change and if youll create new function or make change in existing function
1 a mentioned before the document is good for most of the part except that key aspect of the implementation are missing which leaf me wondering about how exactly they are going to do this i would like more detail on this so called api
0 the chart and diagram are well done and help explain how the code will work
1 the document doe not explain the reason behind creating the new class reportstrategy
0 the explanation provided are granular and do not leave any lingering question in the reader mind
0 the team is using external tool to do the work and it clear and easy
0 yes i do not find any information missing
1 the explanation for change are just an overview of what need to be done and doe not focus on the change to be made in the file
0 everything ha been described well and in detail
1 the write up couldve been organized in a better manner and the author couldve given more attention to detail for example i see they mention the project e but without a hyperlink it wa a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project the search bar didnt help matter too it couldve been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented and what improvement this one doe also the document doe not cover testing even some basic test case a little formatting inconsistency the heading flowchart always ha a colon attached to it but none of the other heading do
1 the test plan section is included however only the framework to be used is discussed i would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test case they plan to include and work on
0 yes it cover all the functionality
1 there are no solution proposed just the issue are listed and explained a possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution
1 the design is indeed very simple because i dont know what it will actually entail to complete the last part
1 yes the explanation provided for change to be made are clearly mentioned the author are very clear what and where to make change use of flowchart make reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily suggestion no test plan is included in the project
0 did not find much info on the design
0 well designed
1 yes the design includes a test plan in the end this too is very abstract about line total and just state the use case tip use the it should format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done
0 flow diagram explains the flow correctly
1 yes the author have tried to explain what change are required and what they plan to do however i feel that exact change that they might be doing are missing they could have listed most file that will need modification and if necessary new file that will be changed
1 team have decided to give all detail after final submission a design doc should be available before starting the project i would recommend to provide few detail on project design class involved in the project or application flow etc
1 the author have not specified any code change a of now so i cant comment on it suggestion you might want to add any api adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future api implementation
1 the testing plan is very neat and comprehensive they could have handled more edge case
0 yes the author have made change to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
0 design seems correct
0 no problem found
0 i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who ha a test plan like this
0 the change are clearly stated and represented
0 the author have explained the required change in a concise manner
0 the author have very well explained all the change that need to be done with the help of proper problem statement the file that require modification the current and the required state
1 a the design document section is missing i can not review the quality of their proposed design
1 yes the author have tried to explain what change are required and what they plan to do however i feel that exact change that they might be doing are missing they could have listed most file that will need modification and if necessary new file that will be changed
0 the author propose two change and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make change they could benefit from drawing simple lofi ui card to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their ui design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hour in coding it overall the have explained the process in detail and clean fashion
1 no design proposed can not check any mistake of the design decision
0 yes it incorporates with the functionality
0 yes the document make extensive use of visual aid be it activity diagram uml screenshots of the view lowfi ui sketch of the grade sheet and a prototype of the view showing grade sheet with expertizas color scheme and style convention all these tool clearly project the change that are made to the system
0 there were no flow or uml diagram
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality required
0 design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good
0 it is simple enough and also achieves the required feature
0 the explanation wa perfectly organized and flowing could not have been any better a sample request response of github metric api wouldve made it more amazing
0 the document adequately describes the project description and proposal made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the category selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
1 there is no design given per se but from what i can understand from the document their proposed system cover all required issue
0 looking at the doc it seems like the design is precise the description of the change are provided in detail ensuring the satisfaction of the reader
1 the team ha discussed the implementation detail of calculating the composite score however a stated above the documentation lack the detailed design that they are planning to implement
1 everything look great you can add test plan for this a it a big change in functionality
1 although the textual explanation is succinct and nice there not yet diagram or other visual aid available i think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful
0 the team explained them design very well it is easy to follow their idea
1 in the uml diagram the set of action that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added also add the action to modify the display sequence of existing question in the instructor flowchart the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing question is missing
1 a said in the previous review though the ui mockup explains the functionality it could have been more legible
0 explanation is good and easy to understand proposed solution look good a well design and implement a solution that handle github hasnt been explained
1 the design seems to follow appropriate principle and pattern it is simple and clearly explains what need to be done and where the change will be made suggestion addition of screen mockups to document will help reviewer a lot
1 it is well written document at this point most of the team will be getting ready on approaching the problem so team is yet to fillout implementation plan remaining part are well written
0 all the required part is in the document
0 the proposed change have been explained in a simple manner
0 the design seems to be very simple i think the team ha avoided unnecessary complication and are doing minimal change to existing system to solve issue given to them
1 yes all the functionality including viewing submission viewing score viewing review report author feedback report teammate review report are all available i believe a more intuitive detailed explanation or description might be even more useful while describing the functionality in the design here such design is still just simply stated a the project goal
1 there are no solution proposed just the issue are listed and explained a possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution
0 the author have done good job explaining the change to be made to the system and even explaining why other more obvious option are not chosen it still sound like a complicated change to make to the system
0 yes
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
1 good test plan should include more test case that check the functionality of github integration eg if number of line of code committed by a student is correctly computed
0 they have mentioned all the change that have to be made to fix the issue the screenshots with which change are to be made in the code explains a lot
1 no uml diagram present suggestion although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like the team could have mentioned a use case diagram or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality
1 both the problem and proposed change are clearly detailed my only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location a the solution to it otherwise one ha to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed
0 the sample data visualization is good the way they have given visualization for sample data is nice easier to understand and good
1 it doe list out all the functionality but there seem to be no solution for them only a basic layout is present an insight into the solution to be implemented would be suggested
1 cant say a code is not visible
1 the design document ha incorporated test plan but they havent been explained neatly only the skeleton for the test ha been provided theyve should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify
0 yes it includes all the functionality
1 class level detail are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc they have mentioned use of existing gem that need investigation
0 the team is using external tool to do the work and it clear and easy
0 they seem to have a clear idea of what they are going to do
0 they author have explained it well they have also mentioned which gem eg oktokit ruby toolkit for github api that they plan on using
0 yes it doe appear to be simple a possible
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the staggered deadline assignment section
1 the problem are described very nicely when it come to change to be made file to be modified are given i feel more explanation need to be given with respect to change in these file for each problem stating why this file need to be changed and what the impact will be
0 yes
0 yes the document seems to be perfect it doe follow all the appropriate principle and pattern no suggestion required
0 the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the table and how they plan to work with them a well the example provided help understand how the data will be stored
1 the design lack diagram to state what the change they will do and how it will be like after change it is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed
0 no design ha been yet proposed by the author however i feel the author is on track to make the right change by looking at the file intended to be modified
1 the team ha not included any additional diagram apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage the flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of action that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criterion set
0 yes the design appears to be simple
0 yes only view file are involving since this topic is about changing the language
0 this team consistently us great diagram that add to their documentation clarity significantly
0 great use of mock ups and uml diagram it make understanding the issue easier look like a great amount of thought ha gone into making it
0 yes the design is simple and straightforward in personal opinion it could not have been simpler than this great work on design
0 the test plan is provided in the functionality implementation describing the functionality and how it will be tested
0 the explanation are more than sufficient not only have the author explained the change to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those change i like the way that they also explained the other different way they couldve integrated the github metric but avoided those method with sufficient reasoning for the samethe team ha also given an explanation of their database design modification would be like which is good
1 the author propose two change and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make change they could benefit from drawing simple lofi ui card to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their ui design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hour in coding it overall the have explained the process in detail and clean fashion
0 i dont see any of the above mentioned problem happening since the design match perfectly with the objective the topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of reviewmappingcontroller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better
0 the design doe appear to be a simple a possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
0 the author have dived into the depth when explaining the change all of the change are well defined and precise
1 the complexity is again a big unknown to me a they have kept the algorithm a a black box it is unclear where the algorithm change are to be implemented if it is in a controller and if yes in which controller i suggest the author to provide internal detail of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better a of now i am clear about their input and output format however i would like to know which function do they interface with
0 the author can add the project purpose why this feature is importanthelpful the author have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jquery to sort the table but no design plan is included i suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it wa clearly mentioned in the requirement to not include it
1 the author do a great job of explaining the technical detail and the api functionality of the requirement furthermore they provide a list of file that are going to be changed in the scope of this project however the document would be more complete if the author provided more detail about specific of change for example the description of high level change pertaining to the offscreencanvascontextrenderingd is adequate but it would be better if the author elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out
0 they have documented it in a very rehearsed manner
0 yes they have done a great job to adequately explained their change
0 yes they explained a lot for the change great job
0 the design seems to be flawless all the principle and pattern used are flawless and to the point
0 yes it doe appear to be simple a possible
0 the explanation wa perfectly organized and flowing could not have been any better a sample request response of github metric api wouldve made it more amazing
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality
1 the test plan doesnt seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation it simply give direction for running test
1 the explanation given show that they have put thought into their project however in issue solution they are not clear about the path ahead they have vaguely stated that the solution might be complex
0 yes the design look simple no complication and the screenshots are really helpful
1 the team ha included test plan in connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenario one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text no more test case can be added to check if the team part in the project is implemented well some test case scenario that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm for example to detect review response that generate the generalized suggestion for all the project can be included
0 the flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the change need to be done
1 the technical change required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly this make it difficult to understand the problem statement properly some highlevel domain knowledge and requirement background will be helpful
0 i can not remember what the explanation looked like last week but the read through this week felt very clear the organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project the problem statement felt like it wa reduced to a clear concise set of requirement that are attainable the addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation a to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectation
0 uml diagram are not mentioned but since these are ui change the change are sufficiently explained with the help of representation of ui in term of image
0 yes the author have nicely explained the change to be made this includes the flow diagram uml diagram and many of the screenshots good work team suggestion could include screenshots if any of the test plan implemented
1 the only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page more uml based diagram could increase understandability
0 in round one team ha well explained their approach and how are they going to do it in this round they have included detailed information and mock ui it wa easy to relate their approach their test plan is also thorough i think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new change good job guy
1 the wiki could have been organized better it look a little messy not self explanatory the use case doe not have any actor in it suggestion code screenshots could have been placed better
0 yes it doe
0 the change provided appear to be sound
1 test plan is very shallow only the heading are mentioned a proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding
0 the explanation provided by the author seems to be good they have referred the rail internationalization api guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support they have mentioned the different element that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally in addition they have also added mockups to visually represent this information
0 simple design with the use of interface and apis
1 there are mockups of the end result but there are no other uml diagram there should have been some uml diagram to help explain their design better a well a the flow of the implementation
1 the author have shown screenshots of example output a a part of visualization this show the original page the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to hindi though this visualization display the final output there is no visualization that show the design and implementation of this new feature
1 the design document ha mentioned the issue which need to be fixed but why these issue are occurring and what will the solution be is missing
1 there is an er diagram help the reviewer understand the relationship between different set maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar etc
0 their explanation is adequate and easy to understand
0 the design document cover all the possible case and should be fine
0 the author have explained the workflow very well with respect to the different type of user involved in the particular feature the language is simple to follow
0 explanation are easy to follow
0 the design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practice
0 the design document is very simple and easy to read detailed explanation about the objective the proposed plan for each objective database schema and the user flow chart is defined clearly the team could have added crc card to improve detailing about the code change
1 the overall design look good the score calculation formula still look a bit weird using the current formula it is possible to have a higher composite score than each of the individual score which should not be the case
0 yes the team ha used flowchart and diagram which clearly describe the change to be made to the system
0 the document wa very well written previously too and they have improved it with diagram and test nice work
1 problem statement is too brief design should talk about proposed solution too short
1 more effort should be expended on the designthe current explanation talk only about change in the view it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth
0 yes this is done very well
1 since no solution ha been proposed yet this couldnt be reviewed
0 the team ha analysed the existing design principle used in the project and ha appropriately defined the design for the new change which will be made the design look good and easy to implement great work done
1 the class diagram is very useful and the mock ui with indication on it make it more useful
0 the flowchart used are very good and do a great job of conveying the intended purpose of each solution presented
0 refactor the reportformatterhelper into a reportscontroller where the reportscontroller implement a strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report if that is correct then yes their explanation is great
0 overall the design proposed seems good
0 the implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rail guideline and doe seem to follow the dry principle
0 the change have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity the implementation seems extremely clear
0 enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement ha been given overall explanation is good
0 yes a far a i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned all the github metric mentioned in the requirement doc
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation
1 the team ha attached a bar chart for visualization which help in understanding their purpose suggestion more visual aid could have been added the stacked bar chart a mentioned earlier more mockups could have been added
0 the design appears to be simple and is easy to understand
0 a flowchart and graph ha been shown in the documentation suggestion i feel that there should have been mockups of the screen where the functionality will actually appear team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page there could have been use case diagram too
1 the issue have been identified and documented clearly however a little more of explanation is required for the solution proposed for issue they seem to me at a very high level
0 yes a good test plan is also included
0 the team have written a test plan but i feel more test case could have been written to test the edge case also the team could have explained their test case in more detail
0 the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principle
0 the change are apt and easy to follow it make sense
0 yes the author have significantly improved the writeup and very adequately explained the change that theyve made
0 from the reason provided for choosing the google chart tool and it effectiveness it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed
1 the design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project howeverit would also be nice to know what feature would be tested in the test plan
1 the author have provided a high level solution to the problem statement they have mentioned that they are going to use an api for suggestion detection but have not yet identified one suggestion you can survey on the existing apis and discus about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza this will improve your writeup significantly
0 the design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practice
1 the author ha very well given a background of the system and the problem which form a lucid idea of the change intended by the author in the system however the author ha only given a very high level view of the change to be incorporated in the system there is not much of an explanation nor an implementation
1 i felt there wa just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year project even if the current project is to extend a previous one the document arent supposed to be copied almost word to word the only major addition i see is the last section none of the diagram correlate to the new change being made they are contextual to the older project testing plan is missing from the document from what i know even the development project need that section even when the older document wa used no reference have been provided for it
1 the document clearly state what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature however i would suggest them to include how will they implement it there is no explanation of how thing will be done
0 they have covered all the test plan along with detailed step
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation flowchart and mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change no suggestion required
0 adequate explanation wa given
0 yes design doe include a welldescribed test plan the provided test will surely test the functionality which will be implemenedt the test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including presteps and different testing expectation great work no suggestion are required
0 the test case described will cover the functionality described given that they write multiple test with the same structure a described for all search criterion
1 no visual aid in the design document
0 the uml diagram mentioned her is a flow chart representing the flow of the functionality it is designed in detail which explains the flow of the functionality quite well
1 the project purpose seems to be only a user story that say whats the deficiency of te corrent issue and a terse solution i wonder if thats comprehensive enough i would add some more detail in term of the purpose of each function being changed in a lower level there only a highlevel solution and which file to change for the project design they are not detailed enough i would add some more plan in term of how to make the change when to do the change if the change are interdependent there no testing plan yet but i think that should be stated
1 neither the project purpose nor the testing plan or the project design is given the project just state what are the proposed solution
0 with proper documentation the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier
1 the author provide a list of file that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what need to be done the rationale behind using a tablesorter jquery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team need to discus more detail to further clarity the solution
0 no change ha been done
1 no all functionality are not incorporated design and implement a solution that handle github is missing
1 no not clear
0 using a lofi sketch the team clearly show the intended output
1 the design document state all the required thing right from project design to test plan the doc also specifies what all file will be change along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed suggestion i feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate the team did mention one scenario i feel like there could have been many more but a all the required thing are present i am giving this post full star
0 yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
0 uml is missing but er diagram is given you can add a uml diagram it explains thing better
0 the test plan is designed efficiently they have described the ui test and automated test which cover most of the case
0 us uml diagram and image to explain where the change will be made
0 yes the team ha well explained the change that they are going to make last time it wa a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagram and mock ui screen the solution seems clear now
1 the uml diagram are missing but they are compensated by suitable explanation i could follow it very easily
1 a such the project description doe not ask for any visualization but visualization in term of uml diagram or a crc card would have been a helpful way to make the description better
0 the design is really crisp and easy to understand one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured a well
1 no design proposed can not check any mistake of the design decision
0 thye provided a lot of solution which is great
0 yes the design appears to be sound there could be some rearrangement in the mockup layout eg text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface
1 uml diagram and the solution proposed by the author to solve the issue is missing
1 there is no test plan for this project it could be difficult to test the exact time returned however it would be a good idea to test that the report page in fact show the statistic
0 the team ha analysed the existing design principle used in the project and ha appropriately defined the design for the new change which will be made the design look good and easy to implement great work done
0 an appropriate test plan is included in this design doc
1 the documentation covered almost everything from project purpose design flow a well a some info on what file will be changed in the project suggestion i feel that the test plan wa a bit vague some more detail should have been provided for example what all feature will be tested or maybe some info about edge case and different scenario that will be covered
0 it is easy to follow the change that the author have proposed
1 the author have included a uml diagram which explains a flow of the diagram the document doe not strike a balance in the use of visualization it lack at illustrating the change using appropriate usecases mockup screen to show the expected change a opposed to the current scenario the mockup screen can include sorted value of the field whose header you clicked upon also there is no need of other visualization aid such a class diagram a the modification are limited to view
0 screen mock ups are good
0 implemented major of them
1 there are no section titled project design or project purpose
0 yes the requirement are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the point
0 yes the author have made change to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
1 no uml diagram
0 necessary diagram are included
0 the design doc is completed and give exact information on what author are gon na do
0 the design follows appropriate principle but no design pattern have been used
0 yes the design document incorporates all the functionality stated in problem statement
0 yes it doe
0 design document ha all the necessary information like project design test plan the team ha gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation also they have included code snippet which show thoroughness of their approach
0 the change mentioned seems to be well thought and written a they are well explanatory with adequate description the doc cover all the issue
1 implementation detail are missing but the testing plan is ready
0 yep they have good structure to show what and how they gon na do with the project
0 great use of uml diagram flowchart and mockups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work it is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like
1 no visualization
1 uml diagram are not provided please add it
0 the design is simple
0 the project doe not have any testing involved
0 yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
0 the design seems straightforward and simple
1 the design look simple and clear
0 they include a very described test plan it ha everything proper what framework what test all this information is well included they clearly specify what they aim to test
1 the document is really descriptive about what work need to be done however i would suggest them to properly structure the document one find it really difficult to understand the flow of the document
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the review section
1 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the uml diagram for review section
1 the explanation are provided a point which is very easy to follow and understand though the need for the proposed ui change is not very clear to me few more detail on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful
0 the design includes the test plan
0 good design
0 yes it is thoroughly investigated
0 the test plan is compatible with the problem statement
0 yes they have added mock ui screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do
0 the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it visualization is among the best ive reviewed till date the author ha put in a lot of effort for the same the diagram make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
0 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the test plan and the proposed design section
1 yes the design includes the test plan however the test plan could have been more low level instead of just writing it should statement
0 all basic element are included
0 the author have mentioned several approach in which these functionality could be implemented their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principle
0 so far the idea is clearly articulated few thing which are not defined are explicitly stated in the doc
0 the team ha put uml diagram for every issue which clearly explains the issue and the workflow
1 the project consists of five independent problem the scope of which is welldefined in the design document the team provides visual diagram in the solution description which further improve the explanation of change the fix for the issue issue related to staggered deadline is backed up by a discussion about relevant db table and corresponding part of code one minor improvement would be for the author to highlight the specific part of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code moreover the solution to the issue issue related to instructor assignment participation is not specific enough ie it is not clear which structure are going to be affected by the change all in all the document doe a great job in explaining what change are going to be introduced in the system
0 the team ha done tremendous job in adding visualization aid they have added application flow diagram for every actor along with the uml diagram of the student and instructor they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self review and score page this make the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand
0 the team ha added their mock ui which show they have thought about the change and modification mock uis of the screen show they are halfway the project
1 there are no solution proposed just the issue are listed and explained a possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution
1 the test plan given is not concrete just mention what should be done but no actual step for them
0 the test plan is compatible with the problem statement
1 the team ha provided solution for all the issue but one for issue the team ha only provided a flow chartdescription of the issue graphically but the code which need to be changedadded should be looked upon suggestion the team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the file and the logic behind the proposed solution
0 no problem i could observe
1 the team ha very well explained the change they are making in the project to achieve the functionality however they have not included any design explanation explicitly they have not described the approach they have come with it might be helpful if they could add the design approach a well in the wiki link so that it easier to understand the code change by having a glance at the design pattern
1 the team ha already identified the file to be changed which is a good thing it look like all change will be handled in the clientside so not applicable
0 not required for this project
0 the er diagram seems to deliver the task
0 all the diagram are great and none feel extraneous
1 the design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance but not much is included for integration of review performance suggestion the topic of integration of review performance can be talked about in brief
1 the author ha not written any plan about the implementation it only state the problem statement the author need to do more work in the writeup
1 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution they have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution
1 the problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart however some screenshot of the screen where change need to be made a well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful test plan is not stated in detail it just mention bullet point in test driven development adequately defining the test case is a important a developing a solution a per the problem statement this should be corrected
1 the test plan is shallow it only state what feature the team will test but how the feature will be test what and how many case will be included are not clear the team should expand the plan for each feature they aim to test including specific step and different case
1 cant say in what file theyll make change a it not specified in the document you can add what change youll be making and explain a little more for better understanding
1 the design document give a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test case or what would be tested
1 the project purpose is explained with example but no design or plan to implement is given again under the test plan section a generic method is given but is not specific to the project
0 use of flowchart and step by step explanation simplified their solution it wa easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple
0 yes the required functionality is adequately explained good work in that
0 the design seems to be precise the description of the change are provided in detailthe team also ha mentioned about the api that they will use they have clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use enough effort have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it
1 the design document is easy to comprehendhave explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution
0 two graph provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be more diagram would have been helpful
1 the team ha used screenshots to explain their plan but havent used any diagram like uml or flowchart to describe their flow
0 the test plan section specifies that it doe not require performing any automated test however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the function added to the gradescontroller
0 they have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue the diagram in turn help a lot to understand the flow of the system
0 the document is complete the author have mentioned each functionality in detail also the test plan in explained thoroughly
1 the explanation of how the received data will be storedpresented is something i would suggest the team to add the design document also miss out on where the data will be presented in the view
0 yes the test plan look good it cover all the functionality
1 test plan is specified but uml is missing they have added the er diagram though which i dont think is required here
0 the explanation provided by the author seems to be good they have referred the rail internationalization api guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support they have mentioned the different element that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally in addition they have also added mockups to visually represent this information
0 great work by the team on uml diagram
0 yes the functionality is explained
1 the test plan briefly mention the scenario the team plan to test they can add more about the test case if possible
1 the design ha been listed with a few test plan i feel that there could be more test included suggestion test plan need to be explained more and could provide the code if tdd approach is used
1 yes the design incorporated all functionality required but more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show
0 yes based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple a possible
1 yes the team intends to use gradecontroller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality the idea to involve instructor because of a requestshour limit may complicate the project another idea would be to update metric with a round robin scheduling of get request
1 yes the team ha made a very good testing plan consisting of functional testing which cover almost all of the use case which have been addedmodified however the author could have added code snippet of the same instead of just discussing the proposed plan
0 well done on adding almost everything
1 create class diagram and uml diagram outlining the set of action that the reviewer and the author can perform
0 the design is simple
0 the author have adequately mentioned the desired change in the approach and design section the problem statement give the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student review public the proposal specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new mvc framework
0 yes the author ha provided a sufficient explanation of what change need to be done to the system by giving flow diagram and screenshots about what change they are going to incorporate in their system
1 the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice category so a to be easily readable though the team hasnt made any change since the last update the team could have added a uml diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project
0 well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission
0 the document seems complete
0 i dont see any of the above mentioned problem happening since the design match perfectly with the objective the topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of reviewmappingcontroller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better
1 the project purpose and issue are well stated but the project design have not been included
0 the design document includes flow chart uml diagram and screenshots which is really impressive a it made the document easier to understand
0 the document address everything mentioned in the problem statement
1 the only issue i feel is iapproach to issue is a bit complex or not clear which may lead to increasing the response time of the system
0 the document incorporates all the functionality required and explains the same with an ever so accurate reasoning
0 the document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly
0 comprehensive
0 yes their visualization is good they are clear and well described the change
0 the design document doe not include a test plan a testing requirement is very minimal since most change are in view
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
0 nothing specified
0 change thats need to be made ha been explained correctly
1 no implementation proposed in the design document only placeholder need more detail for it
0 the photo included are superb at showing the expected view they can have more or more star if most of the expteriza work for the github metric wa already completed when they made these screen shot do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality picture of your proposed view in action
0 the test plan section specifies that it doe not require performing any automated test however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the function added to the gradescontroller
0 yes it is fairly simple
0 yes it doe they have given the proposed solution which appears to be simple
1 the explanation is clear it would be better if the author explain more about the strategy pattern they will use
1 no their section solution design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
0 the author have dived into the depth when explaining the change all of the change are well defined and precise
1 since they have not come up with a perfect solution it seems they have been working on that
0 they have include a flow chart to illustrate how the part gon na work
0 well the design doe look simple it is not difficult to understand the principle
0 it seems that the design incorporates all of the necessary functionality it also mention detail of how the team is going to implement said functionality
0 the design document is extremely clear they have done a very good job in the design document
0 yes they have a complete design for testing and include all the case they need to test
0 the document is clearly and neatly written all the necessary section are present with good explanation
1 design look good at high level though specific detail about implementation are still missing i would expect that here they also state that they are using google translate detail on what api they will be using would have been helpful
0 the test plan ha been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end it cover all the edge case and scenario
0 the design seems simple and clear
0 sound so many diagram
1 the author have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategy using a uml diagram the could add crc card or use case or the application flow diagram which will aide in the report presentation
0 the project doe not necessarily need diagramatic explanation but uml diagram have been used which show implementation plan fairly well
1 the author ha very well given a background of the system and the problem which form a lucid idea of the change intended by the author in the system however the author ha only given a very high level view of the change to be incorporated in the system there is not much of an explanation nor an implementation
1 the design document is extremely well written the project purpose is mentioned although it look similar to what is already mentioned in the google design document i would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project how this project is helpful to the system why are these changesproject necessary additionally i would also suggest the team to add a test plan section to their documentation any bug fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge case a well a core fucntionality
0 design document ha all the necessary information like project design test plan the team ha gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation also they have included code snippet which show thoroughness of their approach
0 test plan outline the functionality that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the change
0 clearly explained with diagram and uml diagram
0 there is an er diagram which defines the relationship in the system
0 not so good structure
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand
0 the team ha included a lot of visual aid which complement the document making it a lot easier to understand great work with the ui mockups project design uml diagram
1 there are some test plan in place and others will be done after the bug are generated suggestion it would have been great to have screenshots of the test plan
1 it seems the author didnt have a clear and detailed plan about how to change the current system to meet the requirement they got the direction to do the project but still lacked detail to implement it
0 yes the design follows appropriate principle and pattern suggestion not required
1 though the team have explained their work pretty well the team should think about adding a few diagram to better help in the understanding of the project currently the team have not used any diagram
1 the only issue i feel is iapproach to issue is a bit complex or not clear which may lead to increasing the response time of the system
0 the diagram describe the functioning of the project exceptionally
0 yes the author have clearly explained where and what change are to be made they have provided a clear approach for the various fix in the project
0 the overall design look good however the author can add more detail about the design principle being followed and appropriate pattern to be used
0 simple and clear design
1 no it doesnt suggestion team should add a test plan which includes test for testing the required change
0 the change are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make change only suggestion would be to include more about how these change are going to be done
1 the design is simple the author have discussed the change like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multilanguage support in the design one suggestion is that the author could have described the difference between static and dynamic string used in this context especially since they specify that only static string will be translated but dynamic string will remain in english
0 they have each listed bug explained at the very least and most have a resolution pathway a
0 the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the wiki the wiki contains mock visualization which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do the design flow a a flow chart add to the ease of understanding the test plan explains about the technology that they are planning to use for testing suggestion the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technology to be used for a particular part of code for ed we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graph output the visualization correctly if the sum id being counted to of the class participation etc the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding
0 the doc mention the change to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding
0 test plan have been shown clearly and test are easy to understand
1 uml diagram are not included
1 there is a test plan for part one of the problem state however no implementation plan or test plan for part two
0 yes the document incorporates all the functionalityensuring nothing is missed
0 nice wiki page
1 the team ha done tremendous job in adding visualization aid they have added application flow diagram and visualized image they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self review and score page this make the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand
0 the team ha given a design flow that underline the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand it can make use by giving an example a to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tool that would be used for achieving the task
0 one of the best wikis i have reviewed with good diagram and explanation the flow diagram are really good kudos
0 unfortunately the team ha missed out on adding any visual aid to the document i would suggest that where you list all the column name which would be sorted in each view also add a screenshot of how that view look at the present moment and a lowfi sketch of how the view would look after the change have been implemented
1 a for the design proposed by the author it prof to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of design aspect in their doc they havent even defined an application flow nothing about adding a method to any class ha been suggested a per them most important thing are going to be given in the final doc design
0 the author proposed in a great detail
1 there is no description of what the team plan to implement
0 the design look to be simple and clear to me it clearly state what file are going to be changed and a per my knowledge there is no redundant and unnecessary change
1 mostly yes but the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagram
0 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the test plan and the proposed design section
0 i am giving this a zero because of concern of plagiarism your page ha multiple section that are direct copy paste of the wiki that you linked to you either need to write something original or site that this is not your work consider having a shorter summary of these section and link to the other wiki for greater background a you have already done
1 the design includes a brief test plan that list three scenario namely the regular step to update course page to hindi checking if edit assignment page ha also been translated and checking if other page are translated some more test case like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included the author specify that rspec and capybara is used for testing the new feature
0 the design is simple although the er diagram take a little time to decipher since it is quite big
0 super legit use case diagram some of their picture even had colour i liked that
0 the design document includes all the functionality the team is hoping to achieve they have explained clearly what they plan to work and modify
0 they have specified the file theyll be making the change to and it look good
1 the problem statement are much detailed but they could be more concise the test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation
0 yes their design is clear and sound and the principle and pattern are well used
1 the use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect the symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle but that is a minor error also the use case diagram detail mention student a an actor but the diagram show no instance of student a an actor i think the student a an actor shouldnt be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor view the score thus requiring no involvement from the student at that point in timemention of primary sequence in the use case diagram detail seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated
0 two type of testing are listed and the author list all the case they need to test
0 yes a per the solution provided it doe seem that the design incorporates the required functionality it considers sorting on all the specified field suggestion since you have mentioned the use of jquery tablesorte you may also add explanation a to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field eg name a to how doe it work to sort the entry
1 it would have been good to show the comparison of the score calculated with the old model and the new model this will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just fall in the smell category
1 the design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the button tray from the existing ui the button when clicked must bring a menu of additional report this functionality should consider the mapping to the reviewmapping controller file that will implement the given feature
1 yes they had test plan but only simple test plan they should add some more corner case
1 yes the author have tried to explain what change are required and what they plan to do however i feel that exact change that they might be doing are missing they could have listed most file that will need modification and if necessary new file that will be changed
0 yes this is done very well
1 the team ha done a good job with the uml diagram however in my opinion it would be better if they can add detail for all the class in the diagram
0 the explanation are lucid
0 the design document give detail about the problem statement and give an idea about what is to be done in the project it specifies what file will be modified and the test plan also contains scenario mentioned no suggestion
0 yes
0 change are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more detail
1 yes the design is a simple a it can be the current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots and the change are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table a mockup screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand however reading the material is sufficient a well the change are not complex a they interact with a single view at a time the tablesorter function is also called for each view eg viewsubmissions layout
0 uml diagram are well formed flow chart are easy to understand look like the team ha thoroughly understood the problem statement
1 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work but they are not so lucid so a to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the change in the system
0 the design appear to be good specific gem are also mentioned eg paginate that would divide the document into discrete page
1 uml diagram are not included
0 the design doc is well written and the point to be completed are clearly expressed
0 the design doe incorporate all of the necessary functionality
1 the documentation covered almost everything from project purpose design flow a well a some info on what file will be changed in the project suggestion i feel that the test plan wa a bit vague some more detail should have been provided for example what all feature will be tested or maybe some info about edge case and different scenario that will be covered
0 the diagram describe the functioning of the project exceptionally
0 they have also added the uml diagram which make thing a lot more clearer
1 i dont think anything is missing from their document but it is in general lite i would prefer a few more detail on how they plan to limit review from being viewed until a selfreview is complete or which place they plan on making change
1 since the graph will be constructed dynamically for the entire class a whole the impact on response time need to be considered in case there are a large number of entry to process a this could involve database call
0 yes it includes test plan it is very well written and will test the functionality
0 the flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the change need to be done
0 very well maintained and explained
1 the explanation are succinct however in the controller section it is unclear which controller in expertiza project the author are referring to the author could mention the name of the controller they intend to change and also possible method that might be added to it
0 the test are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
1 no implementation detail given so can not say how they
0 according to the team the specification of the project doe not require u to use automated test but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new feature using the rspec testing framework overall the test plan sound good
1 the document doe include a test plan section however it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing no solid test planning wa described in the test plan section
0 yes look clean any design pattern used
0 their visual aid is well designed and high quality it help the reader understand their total design very well
1 uml mockup and table are absent
1 i think that the author have identified change in the htmlerb file which look right to me a it only deal with the sorted view of instructor report the change must go in the view part of the application suggestion you can try to add a bit of information on whether your change include addition of new code deletion of existing code or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it query do you plan on creating a dropdown like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed if yes it is an addon userfriendly feature
0 all necessary section are present
0 the design doc look complete with all of the detail being covered
0 explained the objective very well also the criterion for completion are also explained
1 actual project work ha not been started yet so code modification have not been mentioned yet but the file to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective
1 the design doe appear to be sound the team ha put most of the use case actor and explained them well the screenshots of the ui are also present suggestion could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet point
0 the design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objective the test plan indicates what aspect are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted
1 they use er diagram to describe the change but i think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task
1 i believe more effort should be expended on the design currently it is still not so comprehensive a lot of detail can be added in term of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented
1 the author mention within their uml diagram section that they are making only html change however they have still not explained how the request will be sent no explanation ha been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the api
1 author ha not proposed any change
0 the author provide a uml diagram to explain the relationship between the class and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button which are really helpful
1 the design document mention nothing about evaluation of how long the api take to return with a json
0 the author have explained enough about the change
0 the design they have right now look good to me it doe not have any issue
0 the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test case that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
0 although the design provided is clear there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work a intended
0 both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose
1 i felt there wa just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year project even if the current project is to extend a previous one the document arent supposed to be copied almost word to word the only major addition i see is the last section none of the diagram correlate to the new change being made they are contextual to the older project testing plan is missing from the document from what i know even the development project need that section even when the older document wa used no reference have been provided for it
1 all functionality required are in the design doc but no content is provided
1 the team ha not proposed any design for the suggested change
0 yes their design ha all of the functionality that are required
0 the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principle and pattern
0 yes the design appears to be sound there could be some rearrangement in the mockup layout eg text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface
0 the sample data visualization is good the way they have given visualization for sample data is nice easier to understand and good
0 i think the writing could be done better with more explanation on why the solution mentioned in the last paragraph are taken and what other approach were considered or an explanation of why no alternative exists with regard to design explained in detail in a previous comment
0 this project is not very difficult so they dont need to follow some principle or pattern
1 this is a very innovative idea well explained design document file needed to be change are also mentioned
1 no testing plan or test are specified
0 expectation look attainable the change proposed are concise and crisp team should be able to do a good job with this implementation
1 the overall quality of explanation is precise and clear isssue and the test plan can be addressed in more detail how the testing will be performed must be addressed
1 it appears from the design that the author have identified strategy pattern for implementation which is a good design i think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller ie specifying the method they plan to add
1 it say what they will do but it seems high level would appreciate some diagram or mockups
0 yes the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear they also provide some diagram to explain their project which is helpful
0 the design document clearly specifies all the issue that are going to be addressed by this project ui view are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirement moreover the author list the file that are going to be modified and the author comprehensively describe how the jquery tablesorter library will be used for three type of sorting one minor improvement would be to highlight the part associated with introduced change that link html table with the library for better readability
1 not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question
1 the design proposed by the team look complex in term of the functionality desired they must backup these change by providing a pictorial representation of the task like the one described in the documentation this can help to understand the project in a better way
0 the design encompasses all the feature in the specification it only indicates supporting one more language though whereas the design document specifies any language it seems out of the scope of the project but what if you used the google cloud translation api to translate the static string at run time then you could support almost any language there might be licensing issue though
0 yes
0 the design appears to be sound and wouldnt conflict with the existing class or method
0 i am not convinced with the similarassignments table schema for an assignment ax there is a foreign key that point to an assignment ay such that ax can be an assignment in say and ay can be the same assignment in but what if one of the review from assignment az which wa in wa really good and we need to include that a a sample and also include another review from aw from a a sample according my understanding this above requirement can not be met with the current db table design something that the team may look into
1 the uml diagram is good but the diagram in the test plan is not very helpful id suggest either another umlish diagram or just a bulleted list of the feature from the report controller
1 the design follows appropriate principle but no design pattern have been used
0 the design ha a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise
0 the design document separately describes every distinct issue and in some case even provides possible finalized fix to the source code
0 the team ha nailed down which part of code need to be modified the change introduced in the design document are simple and minimal and do not require any extensive discussion about the appropriate principle or pattern
1 star all but one problem ha a snippet with the code fix and a rationale explaining why
0 yes the design is appropriate
0 the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objective that need to be achieved the team explains well the purpose and project design they have included the database table which will be modified the team could add a testing plan to make the design document look complete
0 the flow seems feasible
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation flowchart and mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change no suggestion required
0 the entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirement the document aligns with the plan of action and showcase the exact purpose of the project
1 the test plan is clear and effective but shallow manual testing is good but more description should be provided for the automated testing
0 yes the figure added to the wiki clearly indicate the change that will be made to each view the column that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable good work
0 the design is accurate the change suggested are minimal and ensure that dry is followed
0 all good design principle are being followed where necessary
1 the author have explained well regarding their design approach to support hindi language but it ha not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another language in the future i think they can mention if their design can accomodate other language easily or not
0 change are adequately explained easy to follow
1 the doc focus on eliminating the issue and doe not shower any light on the design of the system
1 the design document wa clear and concise however i would like to see more detail on how routesrb and the view will be edited to pull static string from the enyml file the test plan section is not detailed enough
0 team ha added all the diagram and screenshots the document is well explained and look complete
0 yes they have
0 the design doe not seem that complex the team ha clearly mentioned the issue and the way to go about it
1 the test plan cover all the report and their creation a well a data to be rendered using the new button added you can try adding edge test case ie the code should not break if data is empty for a report they have not yet posted the complete plan of testing and plan to update a per the progress i would suggest you to take time to define a testing strategy a it will help in tdd which speed up the process highly
0 design document ha all the necessary information like project design test plan the team ha gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation also they have included code snippet which show thoroughness of their approach
1 all functionality required are in the design doc but no content is provided
1 no not all but major of all functionality
0 yes the design appears to be sound and well made
0 yes everything is incorporated
0 look great test plan screenshots are all given uml is missing but i dont think it required a the change are in html
0 test plan look to be an overview of the functionality in the test plan i see the functionality explained l
1 the document is almost complete includes proper planning and demonstration only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done
0 the test plan section suggests the manner in which the test case will check the functionality of retrieval of a variety of report for the assignment to the instructor each scenario test a similar function of checking whether the report is rendered based on the report type
0 no test plan provided
1 the author have not mentioned the name of the design pattern used but have mentioned the step for implementation
0 the design give a proper explanation of the behavior of the systemfunctionality
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
0 the design seems sound the team plan to add all translation of the static variable in a separate folder i think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system i would like to see this design in action before making a judgement
1 the design appears to be sound for most part of it the linking between the different section seems appropriate the only issue i have is with the mockup in the design detail second change mockup number i think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day i feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information becausei it is common knowledge that many student do not begin project until a few daysweeks would have passed since the assignment is posted so that would leave the initial few day of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to showii the duration of each project varies from project to project assignment had a duration of about day this would mean that there would be about bar chart for each day which would be quite difficult for the tainstructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other team they need to evaluate
1 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the staggered deadline assignment section
1 the visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader
0 the design is concise and clear they have added reference image of how the system would look after their change which properly show the expected implementation result
0 the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the user are student and instructor and the data base is where the action are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of review information also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so a to elucidate the problem statement
0 necessary diagram are included
1 the use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect the symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle but that is a minor error also the use case diagram detail mention student a an actor but the diagram show no instance of student a an actor i think the student a an actor shouldnt be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor view the score thus requiring no involvement from the student at that point in timemention of primary sequence in the use case diagram detail seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated
1 the document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow however initially it appears to be difficult
1 the explanation seem very clear although splitting the er diagram into or more section would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion
0 team ha added all the diagram and screenshots the document is well explained and look complete
0 flow diagram are well thought of and explain the workflow well adequate detail are given for each diagram
0 yes the design seems to be sound
1 no use of any visual aid
0 the wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable but the wiki doe not include any test plan a of now there are a few test case which can be used to write the test plan for eg not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system
1 the design is likely to increase the response time since api request take time it is essential to implement a system that keep track of these api response and disables this functionality when the api is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time
0 yes
1 the author have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution i could easily understand the problem statement from the writeup well written however the test plan is missing from the design document suggestion you might want to add few success test case and few edge test case for removing report
0 the author have added uml diagram a requested in the previous review and it ha made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
1 some aspect of the design are not clearly mentioned eg after the author add new question for the second review how will the instructor validate if the right question that satisfy the requirement of the project are being asked
0 the design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project howeverit would also be nice to know what feature would be tested in the test plan
1 very good explanation and good work on giving alternative it would have been great if the team had added db design a well but the work done is sufficient
1 the design doe appear to be sound the team ha put most of the use case actor and explained them well the screenshots of the ui are also present suggestion could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet point
1 the flowchart added give a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the change proposed suggestion a diagram explaining the plan of change to be made will make the document easier to read
0 the team have a well written design document and and the author have explained the proposed change well the author have also listed each file they are going to be changed
0 the author have adequately explained change made to the system they have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagram
0 the change are very well documented for each issue what are the file that need to be changed is mentioned appropriately the overall design look efficient and avoids any duplication good job
0 the proposed design is simple and no extra change are being proposed
0 this team consistently us great diagram that add to their documentation clarity significantly
1 there is no proper test plan the author have just mentioned the required test that need to be done no proper explanation ha been given about how these test will be implemented
1 the team have done a good job explaining their project but i feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more also more test case should have been included in more detail
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
0 excellent diagram and ui mock ups
1 no test plan is included they can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope
1 it good can be more elaborative also in section where you have added the code change you ca add comment to the code a well for better understanding
0 it incorporates all the functionalites
1 the author ha very well given a background of the system and the problem which form a lucid idea of the change intended by the author in the system however the author ha only given a very high level view of the change to be incorporated in the system there is not much of an explanation nor an implementation
0 the author have considerably improved on the document uml diagram a requested have been added
0 the explanation given is quite easy to understand and explains the solution to the point
1 no test
1 yes it state the plan design well testing can be better represented in term of whether it ui testing or automated test etc
0 a testplan that cover the entire functionality ha been devised it seems sufficient to test the change
0 the solution look like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code smelly
0 document includes test plan however can include more test case
1 the project doe not have any testing involved a such but the author have added a testing plan
0 the design seems to be appropriate and sound it follows appropriate principle
0 yes design is informative change proposal is detailed it describes well about how change are to be implemented
0 the design is straightforward and a simple a possible the team ha thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowchart and mockups this ha greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chance of clutter and confusion
0 the doc is very well written it like a blueprint to the project really appreciate the team effort
0 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work they have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same
1 the author have explained well regarding their design approach to support hindi language but it ha not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another language in the future i think they can mention if their design can accomodate other language easily or not
1 design is very nicely explained with flowchart make the design flow very clear suggestion if a screenshot of actual screen where the change need to be made is added that would be perfect
0 the design appears to be sound it is really well structured it is easy to follow it clearly state the change to be made and the file affected by these change
0 yes the author provide a uml and a screenshot to explain the class relationship and the change they will make which are helpful
0 the doc is very succinct and well written
0 yes it incorporates all the required functionality along with the test case
0 the team ha done a wonderful job in including uml diagram and visual aid
1 i think you explained the change they want to make clear but maybe you can state which file you want to make and how you guy want to change that file
0 enough visual aid used to make understanding the project easier
1 wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like but i did not find any uml diagram or table suggestion the team could have mentioned use case diagram or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality
0 this test plan is simple and easy to follow good job
1 right the project is in it initial phase the overall change proposed by the author are now very unclear about how they are going to work
0 well explanation on problem statement uml diagram flow chart given detailed explanation on problem statement
1 the author ha not used any uml diagram nor any other form of pictorial representation
0 the design appears to be simple given the task at hand
0 yes the design follows simple rail concept and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team us existing gem available to speed up implementation and re use
0 yes their design is very sound and principle and pattern are used appropriately
0 well designed
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 yes very well done in explanation of change and what need to be done screen shot are helpful good work
0 this documentation is the first one to clearly give a background for the project out of all the documentation that i have reviewed until now kudos to the team for taking that extra mile they have clarified the purpose of this project under the task heading a to provide a holistic insight into the performance of each student in a class a an objective the project design includes the view and controller section that project the requirement of the project i like how the team ha listed all the information to be presented in the grade summary the documentation finally contains the test plan where they propose to do controller test to check if the correct model method is called and if the object of appropriate datatype are returned and also if the correct view is rendered they have also listed feature test to see if the correct information is being rendered on the view the team could have added more such test like to test if the sorting functionality work fine
1 well all the important point have been mentioned like problem statement test plan etc though the test plan must include how the proposed solution is going to be achieved which they have not mentioned
0 the visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader
0 really like the graph you guy drawing
1 test plan need to be expanded to describe each unitfunctional test team plan to write for each of the report
1 a per the requirement document test case are not required
0 yes the design follows simple rail concept and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team us existing gem available to speed up implementation and re use
1 i think their design look complicated and there might be existing gem that can be simplified
0 the team have showed what they plan to do in the diagram
0 yes it is fairly simple
1 first of all the doc is not a wiki page which doe not meet the requirement
0 the document doe include a flowchart which show the flow of change however an uml diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow
0 yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood
0 yes their design appears to be sound
0 the doc is very well written it like a blueprint to the project really appreciate the team effort
0 the author have done a very good job at writing the design document their requirement and proposed solution are properly aligned and their approach take all the factor into consideration viz listing the major area that need refactoring changing the code modifying the ui making sure that the refactoring doe not affect the existing functionality they have explained each of these phase with ample explanation
0 the author have adequately explained change made to the system they have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagram
0 yes since the previous round of review i can see significant and positive progress
1 team ha used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowchartsuml to describe how they are solving the problem is missing adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better
1 good work on problem statement and implementation idea however screenshots could have added lofi sketch and flowchart missing
0 yes the required functionality is covered with detail in the document
0 a far a i can tell it doe not appear that the author will add unnecessary class and potentially smell up the code base
0 new design approach is pretty straight forward
0 the test plan are excellent the best i have seen so farit ha accurately taken all test case into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
0 the explanation provided are granular and do not leave any lingering question in the reader mind
1 the test plan is clear but shallow finer grain test should be described not simply functional test
1 the image of web page clearly describe the change to be made to the system however there are no class diagram or use case diagram
1 the technical change required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly this make it difficult to understand the problem statement properly some highlevel domain knowledge and requirement background will be helpful
1 the only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page more uml based diagram could increase understandability
0 the team already ha mockups for their design
1 the diagram show relationship between different model involve in the project helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement but no implementation design is visible
0 well designed
1 the document is a little bit strange it doesnt show what the design of the project but list the concern during the design process it is hard to tell if the team cover all the function but from those problem i can find they design part of the function
0 not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question
1 design is too detailed i would suggest keeping it short and precise
1 all the required part is in their design however maybe you can add a little more detail to your test plan
0 yes appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shot
0 design is good
1 project purpose and testing plan are nicely explained in the design doc it would be better if the project design is more elaborateive
0 the explanation is quite well documented such a including the flow chart kind of bar graph they would prefer and the file that they will update adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman
1 the team ha included all the detail required to implement the given requirement the wiki ha complete detail related to requirement analysis of current design and change required to achieve the required functionality overall great job the team did a great work in analyzing the issue and designing solution for the issue the ui mock ups are included for all the issue which make the document very easy to understand
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality required
0 look like a good test plan and there is a use case diagram their expectation for each of the report strategy is clearly documented in their test plan
1 the diagram only stated the current scenario there no final picture no uml diagram the figure didnt clearly describe the change to be made to the system it should be better if there a uml diagram from the user practice side a diagram for the design plan and also another figure for the final picture how dows it look like when the plan is implemented
1 test plan too brief could add scenario and description
1 this couldnt be reviewed a the design doc is incomplete
0 mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change
1 proper use case diagram have been added for next submission team can add uml diagram
1 the diagram seems to go out of the boundary of the pae
1 there is just one flow diagram which doe explain the activity to happen there is no use case diagram with actor and all the us case expected suggestion the use case diagram would have given better clarity about the system
0 visual aid are very nice especially for the flow diagram
1 the issue explanation an issue solution explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level it need to be broken down all other description are easy to follow it would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the table or the screen shot of the screen were included
0 yes they have
1 the author view of the final result is clear but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented ie what file are going to be changed
0 the test are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
0 the design document list every issue that is being addressed in the project providing comprehensive detail on the functionality that is required for each one
1 the need for two translation apis wa not justified
0 no problem found they are trying to implement the dry principle
0 yes test plan are included
1 yes the design includes the test plan however the test plan could have been more low level instead of just writing it should statement
0 you have a lot of testing scenario which is really good
1 uml mockup and table are absent
0 yes they have included everything mentioned to implement
1 yes the design includes a test plan i think the test can be more descriptive including what is being tested and in which scenario the test is being implemented
1 the background is clear and thorough but the explanation of the change to be made to the system lack detail term such a dom the blob api and ecmascript were not explained
0 uml and class diagram is not possible since the view is the main part the team explains how the final view should look like in detail
1 the diagram seems to go out of the boundary of the pae
0 the design seems simple and feasible
1 yes the design includes a test plan i think the test can be more descriptive including what is being tested and in which scenario the test is being implemented
0 good work good documentation
0 the author have proposed an elaborate test plan and it cover the entirety of the functionality they are building
0 i dont exactly understand how the waveform help to produce the sound for the new browser theyre adding support for but other than that their approach seems solid
0 yes the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand they have also backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning
0 undoubtedly i like their color coding approach it something very simple and apt for the current system
1 i felt there wa just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year project even if the current project is to extend a previous one the document arent supposed to be copied almost word to word the only major addition i see is the last section none of the diagram correlate to the new change being made they are contextual to the older project testing plan is missing from the document from what i know even the development project need that section even when the older document wa used no reference have been provided for it
1 lower level design change are missing author have only talked about config change no mention if the db requires any change
1 overall the report wa concise and fairly clear about what change were being made to the system however the need for the rail internationalization api in addition to the google cloud translation api wa not explained also the report mentioned that string in the actual code were not changing which should have been explained in more detail
1 the documentation look great a a highlevel design document lowlevel technical detailscode level should also be covered
0 yes
1 the write up couldve been organized in a better manner and the author couldve given more attention to detail for example i see they mention the project e but without a hyperlink it wa a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project the search bar didnt help matter too it couldve been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented and what improvement this one doe also the document doe not cover testing even some basic test case a little formatting inconsistency the heading flowchart always ha a colon attached to it but none of the other heading do
0 the diagram describe the functioning of the project exceptionally
0 in a way yes because it copied the project description and illuminated which model they wanted to create in the refactor
1 the proposed solution sound good they havent really mentioned the change in turn of programmer language i couldnt visualize how are they going to make change they have mentioned few htmlerb file but i think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature i think the team could have been more precise in their approach for example they could have included what all new method they need to add or modify the existing one
0 implementation look just like what the requirement asked for no removing of english code
0 yes the deisgn appears to be totally sound the change proposed are very standardized and follows appropriate industry standard
1 uml mockup and table are absent
0 the explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project all the step piece up the project completely
1 the design document look very crisp and clear the work flow proposed solution and test plan are all listed good work a screenshot or two of the test case would have made it even better
1 excellent use of visualization
0 at current state the design doc ha project problem project solution and design diagram and each section ha detailed description of the project
0 enough visual aid used to make understanding the project easier
0 the change proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart stacked or single based upon the project description it is advised that the team look for other alternative like pie chart that would help to span the result with a minimal look
0 the design change a described are sound they are mostly on javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code smelly
0 the design document is well done with proper visual aid and explains the problem being tackled and the proposed solution very well
0 the explanation are lucid
1 the screen mockups were very nice good job i would like to see a uml diagram for the implementation ie how a reference to a static string in a view eventually map to the correct yaml file that would make the design more specific and clear
0 yes the plan seems simple and feasible
0 implementation detail havent been added yet but thats fine a it hasnt been started yet
0 i see that they added an additional flow diagram that is further helping in the understanding
0 the design is good however there is no scope of using bad principle since the number of file that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just
0 diagram are proper precise and detailed to understand the behaviour of the system currently and after making change good effort in making the diagram and wiki
0 design seems simple and correct
1 while i understand conceptually i dont believe they explained their change in appropriate detail simply describing additional column and a flow chart miss the biggest part of these change which is user experience how will window popup what will the new data look like after a review is complete
1 change could be explained in detail i think that is missing a bit
1 please add more detail about the solution how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of
0 yeah their proposed design includes workflow initial step and subsequent step it wa easy to follow their design their solution appears to be sound
0 design is simple and easy to understand
0 the author seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project they also seem to follow dry principle while adding and changing code also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code
0 the design follows the required principle and the exact required pattern
0 the author provide a uml diagram to explain the relationship between the class and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button which are really helpful
1 the test section look inadequate a of now only two test scenario are mentioned and no detail on automation or ui more so no mention of test in the document
1 the explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view and need further drilling down into the implementation
1 can not find test plan
0 the design doc includes the test plan which cover change in the functionality
0 the plan of work seems to be quite simple
1 no implementation proposed in the design document only placeholder need more detail for it
0 the author have justified the use of jquery table sorter by listing it advantage
0 the team ha done a good job with the uml diagram they have also added detail to the class diagram a wa suggested in the last review
0 this design documentation is very crisp and clear explained in detail and well organized
0 the design look fine team ha provided the initial test plan a lofi sketch is available a well the team could have put git link to the test plan code for better organization
0 yes design appears to be very simple
1 the doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project seems like the team still need time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issue identified
0 the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team ha also included all the change that will be made to achieve the desired result great work
0 the diagram is perfect and clear
0 the screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed
1 the section included for this design document cover the intent of the group to find and solve the bug required for their project i am not sure that the introduction section read a an introduction but more a a project problem statement if this is an introduction more should be included a to what is the purpose of the project and what this current introduction content mean
0 the visualization used by the team are comprehensive and well made
1 documentation is proper team could have added db table a well in the design doc
0 the test plan is pretty good and it ha both ui test and automated test
0 the design appears to be sound i would make the same choice they did to address the issue
1 did not find much info on the design
1 uml diagram is missing though the modified ui is explained
0 adequate information given on implementing the solution flow chart are impressive
1 the document seems to be generally welldesigned however i believe that they have glossed over how a link is said to be closed they properly described the additional functionality and the challenge they will likely face
1 i dont exactly understand how the waveform help to produce the sound for the new browser theyre adding support for but other than that their approach seems solid
0 yes the design appears to be a simple a possible the team ha mentioned what need to be done and how they plan to implement it
1 the author have proposed change that they are planning to implement however they have not included how they will go on to implement these change
1 no diagram shown
1 it isnt clear what all the review statistic will be shown in the column if it is just the time spent then thats fine but if there are other detail a well then it need to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell wo affecting readability
0 yes the plan is clear and easy to read
0 the design is a simple a possible
0 i like the part where the peer review ha been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score
1 the team ha clearly defined the objective of the project the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review the only thing the team could have added wa to create a uml diagram defining the class that are changed or added and adding what attribute are added and what function modifiedadded the team havent mentioned any design pattern a such but the proposed plan explains the idea well
0 yes adequate amount of detail present
0 yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which give a very clear picture of how the change are going to be implemented and which functionality would be witnessing the change also a they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more
0 yes the change are completely feasible
0 the change proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart stacked or single based upon the project description it is advised that the team look for other alternative like pie chart that would help to span the result with a minimal look
1 the writeup is well written but is missing a few thing the original problem description how will the change being proposed will be implemented etc
0 the design encompasses all the feature in the specification it only indicates supporting one more language though whereas the design document specifies any language it seems out of the scope of the project but what if you used the google cloud translation api to translate the static string at run time then you could support almost any language there might be licensing issue though
1 test plan doe not contain edge case or the step by step procedure for performing test
1 no diagram present to explain behaviour design
1 there is no test plan
0 the diagram are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team
0 a testplan that cover the entire functionality ha been devised it seems sufficient to test the change
1 team have explained the problemsteps to reproduce are really very clear solution part could have been explained better overall it a good work
0 necessary visual input are present to aid explanation
1 the author have given sufficiently good explanation for the change to be made to the system they have explained which file they will change a well a the flow of the projectone thing that they have failed to mention is what api are they planning to use i would like to know that a that would be a key piece of information for this document completeness
0 the test plan is included in the document both manual and automated testing test plan are given which is appreciable
1 yes the change to be made are nicely explain the diagram and screenshots are in place suggestion there wa more scope to the test plan
1 no uml diagram
1 i dont think anything is missing from their document but it is in general lite i would prefer a few more detail on how they plan to limit review from being viewed until a selfreview is complete or which place they plan on making change
0 the explanation given by the author wa pretty straightforward looking at the explanation it look like the author have thought about different aspect of the problem statement and also of different way to implement the github metric integration feature along with the side effect of implementing it in a particular way eg one would think that adding the metric to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that student would commit beyond the deadline the author have thought not to add the metric to the database which is sound and reasonable
0 the design document is well planned and doe not miss any of the significant detail
1 a mentioned earlier the flowchart and simple er diagram are helpful but i believe these change would benefit greatly from having lowfi sketch and actor diagram instead of flowchart
0 the quality of explanation is good and adequate
1 not much ha been talked about the method to be added but the file specified seems right
0 the design for the feature is simple and clear
0 the design is accurate the change suggested are minimal and ensure that dry is followed
1 the issue explanation an issue solution explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level it need to be broken down all other description are easy to follow it would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the table or the screen shot of the screen were included
0 the design seems to be precise the description of the change are provided in detail team ha clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use enough effort have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it
0 yes functionality mentioned are covered in the doc
1 the team ha discussed the implementation detail of calculating the composite score however a stated above the documentation lack the detailed design that they are planning to implement
1 the project purpose is stated in detail in the introduction part starting from the background and problem statement to improve the quality of report view the purpose is stated in five different small goal separately make change in view submission view score view review report author feedback report and teammate review report five different part in term of project purpose it comprehensive and detailed a for project design it is carefully outlined in the solution and modification of file part i think the project design might need a bit more description in term of what step need to do first and what step need to be done next it seems that all the change are for the ui but is there any ui that can be served a a pattern for the usage of others or is there any implementation of one ui dependent on the implementation of another here i think there need to be more detailed step the testing plan includes detailed step in term of how to test the impl
1 no all functionality are not incorporated design and implement a solution that handle github is missing
0 yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the change made to the system
1 the team ha discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but ha not proposed any design for their approach
0 they have documented it in a very rehearsed manner
1 no uml diagram
0 i see test case properly defined but the test plan is missing
0 the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it visualization is among the best ive reviewed till date the author ha put in a lot of effort for the same the diagram make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
0 the change provided appear to be sound
1 the document doe include a test plan section however it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing no solid test planning wa described in the test plan section
1 design appears to be sound however it is unclear where the nlp algorithm is supposed to go a in will the st iteration use another service to analyze with the button and then a nd iteration will add the local nlp algorithm
1 there is no proper test plan the author have just mentioned the required test that need to be done no proper explanation ha been given about how these test will be implemented
0 no uml diagram
1 the writeup is well written but is missing a few thing the original problem description how will the change being proposed will be implemented etc
0 the design is sound and easy to understand the design proposed also sound logical ie to sort team name alphabetically and grade numerically to sort by both ascending and descending order
1 the author have not included any diagram though the purpose and proposed change are understood the team could have mentioned use case diagram or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality
0 the test plan is quite good a it cover all the test case in the form of test case which test all the functionality for the admin and the instructor role it also considers the negative test case like throwing an exception when the pending instructor try to add more then student to hisher course
1 no design proposed can not check any mistake of the design decision
1 the project writeup is not complete at this moment a there are a lot of thing missing like what the team plan to do and what concretey are it testing technique it only mention the problem statement and an overview of testing
1 diagram are used from previous project no diagram explaining newer functionality
0 yes change to be made are clearly explained
1 the design look good enough it mostly deal with htmlerb file to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllersi do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system suggestion if the detail regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given i did not find any detail regarding about any method that will be used to implement the functionality that too would have been useful
0 yes test plan are included
0 the design document appears to be concise in it representation according to the task specified and proposal described the design appears simple to be executed
1 i dont think the author plan to add method to the wrong class they are modifying the right file the new design doe not appear to potentially make the code smelly but for few issue you havent added any file which youll be modifying only the uml is given you can add them before the final submission
1 only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution please add design and uml diagram
0 yes the design look complete
1 yes the application flow diagram tell of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the student for the particular functionality
1 uml diagram not present but rest of the document seems feasible
0 the author have very well explained the problem statement and the change to be made to the system including flowchart the file to be modifiedadded and useful link
1 i think the file that the author plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate a to the smell of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code so far though the design seems sound there have however been no mention of the existence of any gem i think the author should explore that avenue a well a that would probably simplify their task for example i found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrase into positive negative and neutral i think this is something the author can look into
1 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution they have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution
1 in the problem statement section the first author should be reviewer i think
0 some ui screenshots are added along with design diagram which describe the system the ui or mock ui help in better understanding
1 the design cover all tthe major aspect well i feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way
0 they have explained very well
0 the necessary visual input to aid explanation are present
0 except for the test plan the design doc seems to have all the important detail the team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a testdriven development
1 the explanation is quite well documented such a including the flow chart kind of bar graph they would prefer and the file that they will update adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman
1 detailed design is missing the document cover only the screen shot and high level overview of what need to be done
0 screen mock ups are good
1 the document mention the detailed test case that need to be done but not how it will be done
0 the design incorporates all the required functionality to a good extent
0 they have improved the document to provide a better description of change to be made to the system
0 yes the design is simple and feasible
0 the suggested change seem to be appropriate explanation wa also easy to follow
0 i really like the flow graph the helped me understand what you are aiming to do
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no design were added in the documentation
0 the design is a required following the appropriate pattern
1 the flowchart added give a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the change proposed suggestion a diagram explaining the plan of change to be made will make the document easier to read
0 the design make use of the google chart tool to generate visual chart for specific criterion set based on the design flow it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor
1 the placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema they have also not included the test case
0 this part ha been significantly improved from the previous submission the diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture the underlying problem and the proposed solution
0 it ha most of the functional feature available
0 again it fine i dont understand the change too well but i also dont understand mvc and expertiza very well either but maybe they could have tried harder i do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of expertiza
0 the explanation given by the author wa pretty straightforward looking at the explanation it look like the author have thought about different aspect of the problem statement and also of different way to implement the github metric integration feature along with the side effect of implementing it in a particular way eg one would think that adding the metric to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that student would commit beyond the deadline the author have thought not to add the metric to the database which is sound and reasonable
0 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the implementation section
0 the design seems to be sound i would like more detail on the database of the bacui project seeing a most of u dont know what they look like given that most of u have worked on expertiza project so a short description of the different table the project is going to interact with along with any and all modification would really help understand if there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be nondry or smellyi think the team is good on what gem are to be used
0 the author ha given a proper explanation of how the thing will be implemented by specifying the file that need to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grade
0 the team explained everything required and not leave anything behind
0 the flow diagram are well written and it is easy to understand just looking at them
1 the image of web page clearly describe the change to be made to the system however there are no class diagram or use case diagram
1 the team ha not mentioned about how they are planning to do the change
1 the author have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution which clarifies how their solution will look like however the use of visual aid seems to be inadequate since they have not added any class diagram usecase or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth suggestion you might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern a suggested above to improvise your writeup
0 the design approach seems justified and inline with the functionality required to be implemented they have mentioned step wise detail for all the change they are going to take done a good job no rework required
1 the author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual change are to be made is not yet clear a work on the project might not have started yet
1 the aspect of reproducing the issue are very clearly mentioned and hence test are written briefly which can be easily understood
0 clearly defined bug and problem statement but no implementation detail given so it is hard to judge this criterion
0 yes this is the best design i have reviewed it ha clearly explained the change in step the formatting is great and it very well made with very good design detail and objective it also included the current scenario and a typical score table it should be great if there an expected final outcome visualization a well
0 the document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow however initially it appears to be difficult
1 the doc doe not have any uml diagram however the use of mockup screen are helpful to understand what the project is about
1 the testing plan is very neat and comprehensive they could have handled more edge case
0 the test plan is thorough and contains lot of detail that will make it easy to design rspec test in the future
0 very well explained with sketch and uml diagram the diagram are detailed and easy to understand
1 yes the team seem to have a clear idea a to what must be done and how the result must look it would be helpful if the team gave some insight a to how the composite score formula wa decided a this is the heart of the project
1 yes the author have nicely explained the change to be made this includes the flow diagram uml diagram and many of the screenshots good work team suggestion could include screenshots if any of the test plan implemented
0 the team ha proposed reasonable change to address the problem statement in detail the explanation justifies every change they have suggested
1 given uml diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change
0 yes they provide solution for different problem situation
0 the suggested fix would address all the functionality which is required to be implemented for the problem statement
0 the proposed flow and project task are sufficiently detailed that i can understand the relationship between the issue and how theyre going to solve it in each step
1 same comment a earlier a flow chart diagram is provided but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple i would like to see more detail about the process in an actor diagram
1 the design is quite good it clearly explains what need to be done and where the change will be made however the only suggestion would be to include more uml diagram so that the design becomes more clear and understandable
0 the team ha included a lot of visual aid which complement the document making it a lot easier to understand great work with the ui mockups project design uml diagram
0 yes it incorporates all the functionality required by this project
0 the design is simple and easy to understand the sin wave and the description about it help to properly understand the change made and it impact
0 great improvement compared to the previous submission now it a very well written document good job team
0 the flow diagram are well written and it is easy to understand just looking at them
0 the design document state all the required thing right from project design to test plan file that will be changed along with how functionality will workflow are included in the doc clearly suggestion great work no suggestion required
1 there is le about what they gon na do but more about before and after part
0 the author have explained well on how they intend to test the controller and feature given that the project doe not involve any change to model file i think rubyonrails guide functional test for your controller is a good way to go
1 the team ha very well explained the goal and separation of concern the team could have proposed a way to test the implementation
1 the team ha given a design flow that underline the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand it can make use by giving an example a to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tool that would be used for achieving the task
0 the design is sound with appropriate principle and pattern
1 the design appears to be clear the inclusion of a visual aid that show how the control transfer from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help reader better understand the design
1 one flow chart and one chart graph are included i find the chart incomplete and confusing too i wasnt able to relate how this is going to help real scenario the better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class program
0 all basic element are included
0 it is sound
0 yes
1 the document doe not go much into the technical detail the limited detail provided sound right however more research will generate better understanding
1 more effort could have been expended on the design because in some place they are not sure of the direction and just state that they might have to look into the code and discus with the professor
1 they use er diagram to describe the change but i think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task
0 design is good there might be some change when they start implementing it but it a good starting point
0 the uml diagram included here is a flow chart diagram which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow
0 no testing plan or test are specified
0 look good only view file are involving the change
0 yes the design incorporates all the functionality required all the issue are explained clearly and their required solution are also given
0 it give a highlevel design picture and two scratch of ui which are all good and understandable
0 the design wa well explained in this design doc
0 great diagram explains everything
0 design is very nicely explained with flowchart make the design flow very clear suggestion if a screenshot of actual screen where the change need to be made is added that would be perfect
0 yes theyve decided to do all there is in the scope of the project
0 the test plan is quite good a it cover all the test case in the form of test case which test all the functionality for the admin and the instructor role it also considers the negative test case like throwing an exception when the pending instructor try to add more then student to hisher course
1 the design document ha mentioned the issue which need to be fixed but why these issue are occurring and what will the solution be is missing
1 class diagram are missing class diagram are missing first flow diagram look perfect second need some modification the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to this should have been done before only you should add a step to perform a check to see if the total student count is crossing the allowed limit if yes then dont add this new student and show some proper error message to the user if no then add the student
1 the author have added the method in the right class the new design is properly refactored and the gem are relevantly used the new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option
1 the document seems to be generally welldesigned however i believe that they have glossed over how a link is said to be closed they properly described the additional functionality and the challenge they will likely face
0 the design proposed by the author appears to be sound since this project is only to sort the view there will be no code added to either the model or controller i hope the team only add one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different column in that view
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 the design is simple and well modularized each method is implementing only one task a it should
1 mostly yes but the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagram
1 project purpose and project design are present and really detailed test plan wa absent though
0 the document is very impressive and provides detailed description of all the proposed change explanation and step given are easy to follow no suggestion
1 diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document
0 yes it doe
0 yes simple straightforward solution
1 yes well designed document ui mockups given it is structured
1 the design isnt extremely simple to understand at first glance but given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated the team ha made effort to make it a clear a possible
0 design document ha outlined the project requirement and issue they have proposed a solution to each problem they have even figured the file and method to be modified overall it look good
0 yes have followed all se practice in design document
0 the design is simple
0 the design doe not seem that complex the team ha clearly mentioned the issue and the way to go about it
1 no test plan wa provided for the part project
0 the explanation is pretty good i particularly found the image explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive
1 a brief description for the class level implementation would be better
1 the design incorporates the basic functionality required that include refactoring the reviewmappingcontroller file to extrapolate it feature to the reportscontroller file it must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the report from responsereport method to the controller file
0 look good only view file are involving the change
1 the document doe include a flowchart which show the flow of change however an uml diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow
1 in the uml diagram the set of action that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added also add the action to modify the display sequence of existing question in the instructor flowchart the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing question is missing
0 the test plan section suggests the manner in which the test case will check the functionality of retrieval of a variety of report for the assignment to the instructor each scenario test a similar function of checking whether the report is rendered based on the report type
0 elaborative test plan which is really good
1 the author have not explained properly the modification that need to be made they have just written the objective
1 seems like all part of the design document need more detail
0 the design is likely to increase the response time since api request take time it is essential to implement a system that keep track of these api response and disables this functionality when the api is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time
1 the author have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution i could easily understand the problem statement from the writeup well written however the test plan is missing from the design document suggestion you might want to add few success test case and few edge test case for removing report
0 test case have been added
1 actually the design seems not simple due to the ambiguous of the design i can not tell clearly what the four link are used to do in the first step but it seems too many link will be used and some strange condition need to be checked before instructor can perform a review in addition it seems not all the instructor can do the review so there may be some error description for step is also complex and seems include a lot of job need to do
0 i dont think the author plan to add method to the wrong class they are modifying the right file the new design doe not appear to potentially make the code smelly the team is using one of the existing gem in their design
0 the test plan is provided in the functionality implementation describing the functionality and how it will be tested
1 few test plan is written the team can add more test plan
0 have updated the test plangood job
0 the given flowchart describes the flow of the project and how the implemented system will work
0 the explainations are succinct the description in technical design section and beforeafter image clearly show what the project intends to do
0 yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principle and pattern
0 there is nothing wrong in current design look good suggestion however since i have already worked on a similar assignment so i know that similar issue ha already been resolved for drop topic deadline you can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type have a look at os project topic check with the professor once
1 the project design and the testing plan are well laid out solution part doe not have any description in it say it will be given in the detailed design could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram
0 yes the project design is meaningful and clear the solution is well laid out
0 they have worked on their weak point earlier their solution doe not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
1 the author ha made a test plan but it is reactive instead of proactive the test plan for the change to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario
1 manual test plan a of now the team is planning to add rspecs after implementation
1 overall the report wa concise and fairly clear about what change were being made to the system however the need for the rail internationalization api in addition to the google cloud translation api wa not explained also the report mentioned that string in the actual code were not changing which should have been explained in more detail
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no use of visual aid diagram a of now
1 there is no description of what the team plan to implement
0 yes the design incorporates all the functionality required all the issue are explained clearly and their required solution are also given
1 the document clearly specifies the problem statement it seems good enough they have mentioned the api they are planning to use a well a the file to be modified however i would like more detail on this api and how they plan to integrate it into their project
1 the document is almost complete includes proper planning and demonstration only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done
1 yes the design look simple the use of mock up screen is good and greatly help understand the flow that ha been proposed good work how ever in one of the flow chart the check for is admin doe not showlabel y or n path
0 yes the author explained the plan clearly the step and the file need to be modified are listed
1 i believe more effort should be expended on the design currently it is still not so comprehensive a lot of detail can be added in term of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented
0 undoubtedly i like their color coding approach it something very simple and apt for the current system
0 it includes all the section
0 the testing appears to be pretty rigorous they have taken into account case when tainstructors score should be excluded the test case could have been better described
0 everything ha been described well and in detail
1 the proposed change section of the wikipedia clearly mention the column name the team would implement sort on but how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail they mention they would use tablesorter jquery but i would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly doe the sorting work
0 yes they provide solution for different problem situation
0 more explanation around only those two graph are being considered is needed while it early in the project at least what change will be made to a file could have been mentioned
0 enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement ha been given overall explanation is good
1 the author have not explained properly the modification that need to be made they have just written the objective
1 the current test written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner case a wel such a what happens if the deadline for selfreview is exceeded doe that mean the peerreview score can not be seen or is a default score of is set
0 the design proposed by the author appears to be sound since this project is only to sort the view there will be no code added to either the model or controller i hope the team only add one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different column in that view
0 not included
1 the writeup show very little since the work ha not yet been started therefore it doe not clearly incorporates what all functionality will be required however there are some mentioned in proposed change area
1 the explanation are good but a layout in the issuesolution form listed sequentially would have looked better
1 no visual aid in the design document
1 no change proposed
0 mockup diagram really make it easy to understand
0 get the github pull metric and show em to a person that person being an instructor
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
0 the author have described all the proposed change well each issue and with it it detailed code is given well written and solid effort
0 according to me the given design incorporates all the expected outcome without disturbing the current functionality
1 fix are simple adjustment to the current code the last issue requires an addition of a full function but i think that it is appropriate to handle the bug fix a it pull that responsibility out and keep thing nicely separated and associated for purpose
1 the overall look of the page is well explained however i could not understand the backend design plan a in howwhere the team will be adding such feature in the code
0 the author have not specified any code change a of now so i cant comment on it suggestion you might want to add any api adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future api implementation
0 yes the design is robust and simple to understand each class and view only handle a specific functionality ie it is modularised
0 a simple enough explanation ha been provided for the functionality no suggestion
1 the explanation given are succinct and clear the flow of implementation seems very clear however a mentioned before i would like more detail on the api
1 the author ha very well given a background of the system and the problem which form a lucid idea of the change intended by the author in the system however the author ha only given a very high level view of the change to be incorporated in the system there is not much of an explanation nor an implementation
0 the author have justified the use of jquery table sorter by listing it advantage
0 all good design principle are being followed where necessary
1 great effort have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it the design will definitely increase the response time suggestion information about the method that will be implemented is not given in the design document availability of such info would have been helpful
0 the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team ha also included all the change that will be made to achieve the desired result great work
0 the design appears very simple
0 design doc contains everything in clear explanation
0 yes they use a lot of diagram to show use case
1 the doc focus on eliminating the issue and doe not shower any light on the design of the system
0 the proposed change have been explained in a simple manner
1 uml mockup and table are absent
0 a far a i can tell it doe not appear that the author will add unnecessary class and potentially smell up the code base
1 everything look great a they have added the uml diagram ad explained everything in detail test plan is missing which can be added a they are solving a lot of issue in this project
0 the design approach seems justified and inline with the functionality required to be implemented they have mentioned step wise detail for all the change they are going to take done a good job no rework required
0 the team ha added their mock ui which show they have thought about the change and modification mock uis of the screen show they are halfway the project
0 yes i believe so they discus what they need to track during a review and what they need display after a review is complete
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
0 the chart is also in a great detail
1 the file to be changed have been properly listed i feel more explanation ought be given a to why these file have been modified and in what way
0 yes
1 yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principle and pattern fell the team could have explained in more detail
1 the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice category so a to be easily readable though the team hasnt made any change since the last update the team could have added a uml diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project
1 the author propose two change and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make change they could benefit from drawing simple lofi ui card to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their ui design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hour in coding it overall the have explained the process in detail and clean fashion
1 the design appears to be clear the inclusion of a visual aid that show how the control transfer from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help reader better understand the design
1 the author have proposed to create a view for grade summary with the detail pertaining to the assignment grade topic review score and total score for each student which get rendered when a assessment tab icon is clicked this change seems logical they have also depicted a lowfi sketch of the projected page and screenshot of a rough prototype these change seem logical to me i wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited a prior work in the background the documentation could have added specific of the file that they wish to modify or create
0 the er diagram seems to deliver the task
1 actually they may include too much info which could be replaced by some link
1 it appears from the design that the author have identified strategy pattern for implementation which is a good design i think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller ie specifying the method they plan to add
0 yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagram illustrate the flow of control very well
0 yes only a few file are being modified
1 the design document is very simple and easy to read detailed explanation about the objective the proposed plan for each objective database schema and the user flow chart is defined clearly the team could have added crc card to improve detailing about the code change
0 yes clear and simple
1 the need for two translation apis wa not justified
0 the team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the score and indicate the performance of student
0 the design document list every issue that is being addressed in the project providing comprehensive detail on the functionality that is required for each one
0 the design doc is clear and well written the author have done a great job explaining the project purpose and their design plan with the use of lofi sketch and prototype for the required view i would suggest the team to include file that are involved for this project overall good work
0 team have shared the link for the tablesorter which explains the functionality
0 the design document includes flow chart uml diagram and screenshots which is really impressive a it made the document easier to understand
0 no visualization or diagram are necessary
1 the design incorporates all the required functionality the team could have added use case or crc card to help convey which part of code they plan to change and how overall the team conveys their objective
0 the design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well
0 the design seemed good
1 this logic to calculate composite score composite score max score self review score peer review score is basically taking the min score not sure what you are trying to achieve here it is not a good measure to calculate composite score
1 the image of web page clearly describe the change to be made to the system however there are no class diagram or use case diagram
0 the change proposed are good and clearly meet the objective of the project
0 mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change
0 the design doe appear to be a simple a possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
0 the team ha explained the issue and their solution clearly the design is simple hence easy to understand the proposed solution section is well written where the team ha described the change made in respective file
0 well structured i think everything is covered
0 the design seemed good
0 the author have prepared the design document quite well
0 yes the plan is clear and easy to read
1 the document specifies the problem statement and the analyze functionality they want to incorporate however the design document seems to be incomplete a they have not talked about the exact identified functionality ie analyze and the design document section is empty suggestion you can talk about method you want to add or existing method you want to modify and how i think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section a mentioned by the professor
0 all problem statement have been explained this time including an elaborate test plan
0 the team ha included all the detail required to implement the given requirement the wiki ha complete detail related to requirement analysis of current design and change required to achieve the required functionality overall great job the team did a great work in analyzing the issue and designing solution for the issue the ui mock ups are included for all the issue which make the document very easy to understand
1 only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution please add design and uml diagram
0 the screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output it would be nice to have a design diagram
0 yes the author have clearly explained the change to be made to the system document is simple succinct and easy to understand great use of flow chart uml diagram and mockups to visually represent the information is done
0 they have pretty good test plan a there is no code yet
0 this team used great diagram that add to their documentation clarity significantly
0 the test plan is complete the team plan to test the two possible case when the review is blank response should be no review in text box when review is present response is the result of suggestion metric analysis the team is right in testing just these two case because they should not test if the api itself is returning a correct response a that would be against testing rule
0 uml look good follows the convention
0 they provide picture of their sound wave
0 yes the design appears to be sound and appropriate
1 the team ha clearly defined the objective of the project the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review the only thing the team could have added wa to create a uml diagram defining the class that are changed or added and adding what attribute are added and what function modifiedadded the team havent mentioned any design pattern a such but the proposed plan explains the idea well
0 the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it visualization is among the best ive reviewed till date the author ha put in a lot of effort for the same the diagram make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
0 using the report interface to assist with specialization wa good
0 the expected outcome of the project have been clearly explained and requirement well understood
0 they have added a screenshot for each of the problem they plan to tackle
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 it includes all the section
0 the test plan section defines the step needed to manually test the functionality but i would suggest the team to also include the logic they propose to use in the rspec test the object they would mock etc
0 design document contains all the functionality required
1 the document show the flow of work really wellhowever i would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tool and technology that will be used this will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent
0 the design document incorporated all the functionality that the project is supposed to be implementing no suggestion
1 the design look solid but it hard to tell without sufficient detail if anything causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that us the current language to return the correct string is more dry and maintainable than what we have now i wonder if dynamic translation gem are out there or would work the claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended eg it would take too much time
0 yes they use a lot of diagram to show use case
0 the design proposed is the natural way anyone would go around solving those issue for example creating separate yaml file for different language and then picking up the string from there
0 the author add more diagram to help to explain the change they are going to make the relevant table are really helpful
1 nice mockup for another language it is clean the menu bar for translated language screen is still in english i assume it is just a careless mistake when make the mockup
0 the document seems complete
0 great effort have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it the design will definitely increase the response time suggestion information about the method that will be implemented is not given in the design document availability of such info would have been helpful
1 wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose what change need to be made however including a mock test plan would have been better
0 the design incorporates all of the functionality required
0 the explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like uml diagram explanation of the use case etc
1 the design document is well explained the author havent mentioned any design pattern a such the author have clearly stated the proposed change though they could have added uml and crc card
0 all functionality required are in the design doc but no content is provided
0 yes the design follows simple rail concept and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team us existing gem available to speed up implementation and re use
0 since the project is aimed at fixing the issue no design pattern need to be used
1 the design isnt extremely simple to understand at first glance but given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated the team ha made effort to make it a clear a possible
1 their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the popup text message a json and displaying suggestion metric for the review segment a block of review a comment box try to include test case where a review message is absent ie the code should not break for empty review segment include a test case where review segment ha a suggestion and test if the output say suggestion present include a negative test case for the the suggestion where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer and test that the output say suggestion absent
0 the document is clearly and neatly written all the necessary section are present with good explanation
1 same comment a earlier a flow chart diagram is provided but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple i would like to see more detail about the process in an actor diagram
0 the team ha mentioned all the file that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed change the team could also document the change that are being made to individual code file stating the change done using code snippet and the reason why the change are being made also they can talk about what design pattern principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed the team could also use crc card to depict the proposed code change this will not only help reader understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team member and fast tracking the completion of project
0 the design appears sound
0 yes it incorporates all of the functionality required
0 they have explained very well
0 it is extremely detailed eagerly awaiting update on implementation and on code snippet a and when they happen
0 the author seem to have understood the project and know what change need to be made to what file the change seem to be targeted to the correct class and preliminary investigation reveals that it doe seem to follow dry principle they might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively this will help in reducing convoluted code
0 yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand
1 not included
0 includes all the functionality
0 yes the design is having also the functionality that is been required it mention also mention a proper proposed solution for all the required task
0 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the uml diagram for review section
1 no umls given
0 the design follows appropriate principle and pattern a required
1 the hand drawn diagram are good enough to explain the problem to others next time they can update it with the actual page once it done
1 the project design and the testing plan are well laid out solution part doe not have any description in it say it will be given in the detailed design could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram
0 the design is apt following the principle and are selfexplanatory
1 though this project doesnt require any uml diagram a such however a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient
0 very good use of class and sequence diagram to explain the entire design flow it clearly conveys the thought process of author and the overall design
0 yes their section method to calculate composite score and application flow section have a flow chart a well a at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
0 the uml diagram is having the correct content but need the rough name of class method
0 yes it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issue it is very clearly explained one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured a well
0 yes they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the way in which they are going to test the various edge case for the various issue at hand
1 most of part are included but they should include more detail in their doc
1 a stated above the team ha not explained any design pattern they are following however they have mentioned all the code change they are making for this functionality implementation the code snippet they have included is very useful to understand the exact code change they are making and the file which are getting impacted this would help the future developer to understand the code in a simple manner
0 enough visual aid used to make understanding the project easier
1 the document doe not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mention the step to be done in order to implement the required functionality
1 it would have been better if a test plan covering change made to the system wa added to the design doc
1 a stated above the team ha not explained any design pattern they are following however they have mentioned all the code change they are making for this functionality implementation the code snippet they have included is very useful to understand the exact code change they are making and the file which are getting impacted this would help the future developer to understand the code in a simple manner
0 it is extremely detailed eagerly awaiting update on implementation and on code snippet a and when they happen
1 i would the test section incomplete the author have mentioned about test case thats all i think that is not at all sufficient also missing are unit test if any and ui test if any i would have liked mention of more test case both automated a well a ui test that will ensure basic sanity to the system
1 the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice category so a to be easily readable though the team hasnt made any change since the last update the team could have added a uml diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project
0 the doc mention the change to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding
0 the step taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed a stated above the approach discus the step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation
1 the design document ha clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed however it look a bit incomplete to me suggestion try adding what were your proposed approach and a clear reasoning a to why did you choose a particular approach you can simply remove the statement on expertiza a the professor ha clearly advised u to avoid doing it
0 please add more detail about the solution
0 i dont think the author plan to add method to the wrong class they are modifying the right file the new design doe not appear to potentially make the code smelly the team is using one of the existing gem in their design
1 the design seems pretty good the only drawback is the test plan is missing
0 yes they have provided an uml diagram which follows convention and explains their approach
1 more explanation around only those two graph are being considered is needed while it early in the project at least what change will be made to a file could have been mentioned
0 the change have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity the implementation seems extremely clear
1 they have included the flowchart of the flow of the functionality that is being added which seems to be designed properly and readable also database table whichthey are going to change is depicted they could add class responsibility collaborator card to further illustrate the code change they are about to make
0 yes the test coverage seems good
0 the design seems to be appropriate and sound it follows appropriate principle
1 impressive writeup flowchart and uml diagram are wellexplained detailed explanation of problem statement and solution to be implemented
0 the design ha been explained in a simple way the team ha explained the design using use case which is easy to comprehend
0 the visualization seem to be complete the team ha included an application flow diagram a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look so in my opinion good job done
0 yes detailed ui mockups were very impressive the use case diagram and explanation are well written
0 the team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the score and indicate the performance of student
1 nothing related to technical part or class is mentioned
1 the team implementation of a uml diagram seems to be a good way of representing the change plannedthe diagram could have been detailed with regard to the class that are being added and modified there should be attribute of each class then the method that are added or changed with the type of input to these method and return type of these method
1 diagram are explanatory but few but i think they are sufficient
0 the author ha not used any uml diagram nor any other form of pictorial representation
1 the team ha done a good job trying to show with picture what their change will look like in the front end no uml ha been provided
1 the explanation are done well but they could be more thorough why is the internationalization api and google translate needed also will you use a script to edit the view how would you do that it seems like too much work to do manually
1 the design look good but from the implementation detail given and the amount of use case listed i feel there could be some more implementation detail that are left out
0 the flowchart make it very clear
1 this is a mozilla project and i am not sure what are the testing requirement and depth to be covered a it is not mentioned in the document but the step mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done
0 the visual aid used are precise and explain the indepth functionality of the project the diagram and flowchart ensure there is no ambiguity in the functioning of the project
1 diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document
0 all the design look reasonable right now
0 i can not remember what the explanation looked like last week but the read through this week felt very clear the organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project the problem statement felt like it wa reduced to a clear concise set of requirement that are attainable the addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation a to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectation
0 no class diagram wa needed and their flow chart and code snippet show the control logic simply
0 great use of mock ups and uml diagram it make understanding the issue easier look like a great amount of thought ha gone into making it
1 the author ha made a test plan but it is reactive instead of proactive the test plan for the change to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario
0 yes it doe appear to be following appropriate principle
1 need to include a flow diagram
1 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution they have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution
0 design flow look good
0 although the textual explanation is succinct and nice there not yet diagram or other visual aid available i think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful
0 yes
1 the team ha used screenshots to explain their plan but havent used any diagram like uml or flowchart to describe their flow
0 yes theyve included all functionality
0 a there are ui change test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
0 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work but they are not so lucid so a to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the change in the system
0 author have explained the change that need to be made clearly
0 the explanation given for the design are quite succinct and dont go into much detail they are just giving a high level overview of the system some of the explanation are thorough in nature kudos
1 no design ha been yet proposed by the author however i feel the author is on track to make the right change by looking at the file intended to be modified
1 the screenshots for the view are great they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution however the design document lack use case or class diagram on how extenral entity interacts with the system and get response since the author are using external apis it would have been good if they could give more detail request and response
0 the test plan section specifies that it doe not require performing any automated test however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the function added to the gradescontroller
0 the uml class diagram help to understand the report involved their attribute and functionality it provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different report
1 the proposed design seems reasonable before proceeding with the project team should also look at other reference to those function and do it accordingly
0 the test plan are excellent the best i have seen so farit ha accurately taken all test case into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
0 the design look reasonable for me
1 a flowchart and graph ha been shown in the documentation suggestion i feel that there should have been mockups of the screen where the functionality will actually appear team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page there could have been use case diagram too
0 the proposed change look good explanation are clear also mentioned the continuous talk with mentor to come up with a prototype suggest you to include screenshots of some positive and negative test in the future submission
1 the design is well explained need clarification on below how will this github metric will be used to grade the student so how will the final mark for a particular be calculated using the data from github
0 they provide picture of their sound wave
0 the design appears to be sound they have weighed their option and are using an official gem to interact with the github api
0 the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the logical flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the proposed design section so a to elucidate the problem statement
0 it wa weird that two of the bug they were assigned dont exist but thats not the team fault
0 they have done this part
1 this seems complete to me they have the introduction with a purpose and problem a ui mockup and use case it doe seem odd that the use case are listed in the test plan
0 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work they have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same
0 yes the design incorporates all the functionality that are required
0 the design document ha included all the functionality that is required by the project description
0 following can be added project introduction motivation description of project
1 there is no mention of testing also code change related detail have not been included otherwise the document is very good
0 yes the document cover very required functionality
0 have updated the test plangood job
1 change are explained but are not very descriptive the document is not much changed since the last submission
0 the team ha attached a bar chart for visualization which help in understanding their purpose suggestion more visual aid could have been added the stacked bar chart a mentioned earlier more mockups could have been added
1 the author explain the project pretty well they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different set however the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge case
0 yes they have discussed about all the functionality
1 yes the design is pretty good the pattern followed avoids any duplication of code but i had made a suggestion in review one to take a look at project and it code the problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused i dont see any mention of it i hope you do take a look before starting to code a it will avoid any rework
0 the wiki is detailed enough that it mention all the functionality required in the project the team ha made sure to explain all the change they wish to make to the system they list all column that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting
1 redundant description
1 yes they have improved the uml diagram from last round and it s a standard class uml diagram it s very selfexplanatory though the diagram under test plan should be clearer also there could have been a sample report generated for reference
1 the design document contains the project purpose and the change proposed by the team the design flow give an overview of the bar graph that the team plan to generate for selected criterias the introduction section however should largely focus on the project description
1 no visual aid have been provided by the author
0 the code design appears to be sound the ui implementation a shown on the screenshot look intuitive however the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly
1 their design are great but some design may be complicated
1 the team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design the test plan is adequate
1 self explanatory visual change have been added all the change are described via the visual aid
0 test plan seems thorough and well thought out
1 not so good structure
0 for now the design proposed look perfect
0 good explanation for all solution
1 there are no uml diagram a such in the writeuphowever there is a flowchart which somewhat give a clear view how they plan to do the thing
0 a flowchart and graph ha been shown in the documentation suggestion i feel that there should have been mockups of the screen where the functionality will actually appear team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page there could have been use case diagram too
0 adequate explanation wa given
0 the team ha provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project overall quality of explanation is good suggestion include the purpose of implementing these functionschanges
0 the design look solid but it hard to tell without sufficient detail if anything causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that us the current language to return the correct string is more dry and maintainable than what we have now i wonder if dynamic translation gem are out there or would work the claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended eg it would take too much time
0 the documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly they have described the functionality change in bullet point which make it very easy to understand the sub part required to achieve the main functionality in simple term
1 code level detail are not covered in this doc but the highlevel approach look fine to me
0 the have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualization the could have added lofi ui card to depict change to view which will help them visualize the change and also help instructor in suggesting improvement at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code change in latter stage of the project
0 the design is concise and clear
1 design document explains the entire project flow very well the whole implementation plan is very well written which clearly explains how the team is planing to work on project the idea of including screenshots which explains how the functionality will look like once all the implementation is done is what i liked the most suggestion team should include test plan in the docthe purpose of project should be explained more clearly overall nice work
1 project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation however the test plan is not stated in the documentation
1 the diagram show relationship between different model involve in the project helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement but no implementation design is visible
1 the project purpose is explained with example but no design or plan to implement is given again under the test plan section a generic method is given but is not specific to the project
0 the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test case that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
1 the project writeup is not complete at this moment a there are a lot of thing missing like what the team plan to do and what concretey are it testing technique it only mention the problem statement and an overview of testing
1 the design is quite good it clearly explains what need to be done and where the change will be made however the only suggestion would be to include more uml diagram so that the design becomes more clear and understandable
0 the whole document is easy to understand and wellwritten suggestion it would be better to include what tool and technology would be used in the project
1 the doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project seems like the team still need time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issue identified
0 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 though i couldnt follow everything overall the design seems to do the right thing
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the review section
0 yes
0 the design doc clearly explains the project purpose project design and the test plan
0 the diagram are succinct and wellunderstood
1 though this project doesnt require any uml diagram a such however a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient
0 the design doc is well designed and complete
0 a lot of visuals very helpful when viewer walk through the design
0 the author have highlighted certain part pf the design where the change were made this make is easier for the reader to understand the change made the team ha explained the change made in a clear manner
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand
1 search questionnaire and search review dont have detailed explanation of what should be done
0 adequate explanation is provided for each problem
1 no code is mentioned to be checked
0 the step by step instruction are detailed and is good
1 the design document is comprehensive and cover most of the relevant topic general problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project the solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several type of sorting that need to be done this is followed by the file that will be modified in the scope of this project the primary problem is that the document doe not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decision and implementation strategy it is stated that script have been added at the top of the file to sort the content of table i would suggest elaborating on the specific what function are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table content
0 yes the team ha well explained the change that they are going to make last time it wa a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagram and mock ui screen the solution seems clear now
1 yes author have done well to explain the change being done in the project i think i wish they would have added is the detail of language they are supporting also they do mention that they will add extra column to language table they could have pasted the new schema in the doc
0 great work by the team on uml diagram
1 no
1 the design document wa clear and concise however i would like to see more detail on how routesrb and the view will be edited to pull static string from the enyml file the test plan section is not detailed enough
0 the proposed design seems reasonable before proceeding with the project team should also look at other reference to those function and do it accordingly
1 the design document ha mentioned the issue which need to be fixed but why these issue are occurring and what will the solution be is missing
0 yes it incorporates all the required functionality along with the test case
1 the document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow however initially it appears to be difficult
1 no diagram present to explain behaviour design
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand i can easily know what they will do through their doc
0 yes the design look simple no complication and the screenshots are really helpful
1 the author have provided a mockup of their final design which seems pretty good however whats missing is uml diagram something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful
0 they include a very described test plan it ha everything proper what framework what test all this information is well included they clearly specify what they aim to test
1 the author have provided a mockup of their final design which seems pretty good however whats missing is uml diagram something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful
0 the design document includes proper visualization it included appropriate flow chart and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project
1 the visualization includes a screen mockup analyze button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output however there is no mockup of the screen of what will the output be like the flow diagram is highly redundant according to me a it doe not portray any additional information about the design i would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm method so a to illustrate their change
0 the design document state all the required thing right from project design to test plan the doc also specifies what all file will be change along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed suggestion i feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate the team did mention one scenario i feel like there could have been many more but a all the required thing are present i am giving this post full star
1 the explanation of each of the issue in detail is done very well but it doe seem to be complicated unless file to be modified and solution are read
0 the design appears to be specific to the requirement for this they have used a uml design which basically explains the flow of the usecase they have not used any principle or design pattern however there doe not seem a need to use any a their change are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using jquery a per the document the design doe not make any redundant change or unnecessary change to the code thus they have done a good job by optimizing the change
1 there is a webpage linked which is helpful but i do not see any other visual aid it would be better to have some screenshots to help the reader understand your project
0 the design change a described are sound they are mostly on javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code smelly
0 author have clearly explained what need to be done and how it would be done
1 the project consists of making a search function to select specific user assignment etc using some criterion so theyre creating a search functionality for individual model
0 the document incorporates all of the functionality a mentioned in the google design document the team have made sure to list explain and provide proposed solution for each bug to be fixed good job guy
1 it isnt clear what all the review statistic will be shown in the column if it is just the time spent then thats fine but if there are other detail a well then it need to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell wo affecting readability
0 yes
0 they explained from their requirement and in their flow that they only need to plan to edit the view so there is no need for a uml
0 the project is complete and sound enough in it approach and the implementation and the test plan ha been well devised and just shy of application
0 the application plan diagram ha been shown it distinguishes between instructor and student
0 yes diagram are selfexplanatory
0 the design doc doe mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different way they can implement the same
0 the design is simple and easy to understand the sin wave and the description about it help to properly understand the change made and it impact
0 the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the table and how they plan to work with them a well the example provided help understand how the data will be stored
1 not included
0 the team ha described change using use case and er diagram to clearly explain the system
1 no visual aid have been provided by the author
1 the document specifies the problem statement and the analyze functionality they want to incorporate however the design document seems to be incomplete a they have not talked about the exact identified functionality ie analyze and the design document section is empty suggestion you can talk about method you want to add or existing method you want to modify and how i think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section a mentioned by the professor
0 author have clearly explained the change to be made to the system the design document wa easy to understand
0 it look more or le right in the sense that the proposed change are exactly what is required to be done in the project
0 yes the design is very simple and explains the change required in a very clear manner
1 no uml diagram present suggestion although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like the team could have mentioned a use case diagram or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality
1 yes the team ha used flowchart and diagram which clearly describe the change to be made to the system
0 great use of mock ups and uml diagram it make understanding the issue easier look like a great amount of thought ha gone into making it
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
1 they have used the design pattern well and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram however im not quite sure whether it right to call the diagram a a uml diagram
0 visual aid are used properly and very helpful in understanding uml diagram follow the convention everything look proper
0 the provided flow diagram and db table are enough the explain the functionality of the project
0 the wiki is detailed enough that it mention all the functinoalities required in the project the team ha made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column name in each report they would add the sort feature to good work guy
1 the project design and project purpose part are pretty detailed however for the test part the author only state that they will write test for the new controller but no detailed test plan
1 the project writeup is not complete at this moment a there are a lot of thing missing like what the team plan to do and what concretey are it testing technique it only mention the problem statement and an overview of testing
0 yes the design is very simple lucid and efficient
0 the test plan is good and describes all aspect of the rspec test needed
0 yes i think it includes everything all the functionality required
1 the design document is easy to comprehendhave explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution
0 yes they have discussed about all the functionality
0 document is very well written and contains all the detail like problem statement solution file to be modified testing plan
0 yes the author have a great job of including all the needed functionality
1 the author need to provide more detailed procedure about how they going to implement their solution instead of the result after they done it
0 the design data includes most of the important information required to understand the team plan
0 very well written document good job team
1 did not find much info on the design
1 functionality feature test ha been included but plan for rspec test is yet to be included
1 no test plan ha been mentioned
0 yes all required sketch uml diagram and view provided great work
0 design flow look good
1 no there is no test plan
1 for each problem the author display relevant chunk of code and discus which part need to be changed aside from the issue all the solution seem reasonable and simple one minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the collect instead of the each method for computing totalweight in validateassignmentquestionnairesweights method
1 the author mention within their uml diagram section that they are making only html change however they have still not explained how the request will be sent no explanation ha been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the api
1 a mentioned in my previous review i can not understand the backend design handling which controller and view file are being modified or will new method or erb file be added any plan to use thirdparty gem or apis
0 it is sound
1 i think the file that the author plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate a to the smell of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code so far though the design seems sound there have however been no mention of the existence of any gem i think the author should explore that avenue a well a that would probably simplify their task for example i found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrase into positive negative and neutral i think this is something the author can look into
1 the team have done a good job explaining their project but i feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more also more test case should have been included in more detail
1 the test plan briefly mention the scenario the team plan to test they can add more about the test case if possible
1 the design seems sound the team plan to add all translation of the static variable in a separate folder i think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system i would like to see this design in action before making a judgement
0 the design follows the required principle and the exact required pattern
0 the use case diagram properly show how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role
1 there were few handmade diagram posted however i feel used of some other highlevel uml diagram and screenshots would have been better
1 the design document contains the project purpose and the change proposed by the team the design flow give an overview of the bar graph that the team plan to generate for selected criterias the introduction section however should largely focus on the project description
1 a mentioned above the design part is pretty weak for a writeup and need to be further worked upon
0 well it look sound to me it follows the dry principle a well
0 the team ha improved their design by adding extra test case and test procedure which were lacking in the previous submission the team ha provided test case for each issue thereby testing every functionality of the project
1 the document is really descriptive about what work need to be done however i would suggest them to properly structure the document one find it really difficult to understand the flow of the document
0 the design document wa wellwritten initially too and still is
1 visualization offer only a flow chart but other uml diagram like class diagram would have been more helpful
1 missing a uml but loved the addition of the lofi sketch
0 yes they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the way in which they are going to test the various edge case for the various issue at hand
0 some ui screenshots are added along with design diagram which describe the system the ui or mock ui help in better understanding
1 code snippet are not mentioned but design is properly done
0 the document enlisted the crucial aspect of the project in the first stage the team ha made improvement in this stage by including a test plan section that list the set of test case to deal with the retrieval issue and plan on including a new controller for the next stage
1 there were no flow or uml diagram
1 the uml diagram are missing but they are compensated by the sequence of step which is easy to follow
0 it say what they will do but it seems high level would appreciate some diagram or mockups
1 design look good at high level though specific detail about implementation are still missing i would expect that here they also state that they are using google translate detail on what api they will be using would have been helpful
0 yes clear and simple
0 honestly in my opinion the team ha given a lot of thought into how to fix the bug the designproposed solution look completely logical and should fix the bug with noleast redundancy it also look like the team ha already managed to fix a few bug a well kudos to them
1 the use case diagram added is drawn well and help explaining the system team could have added screenshots of the expertiza page that would have helped u understand whoch part of the system is changing well
1 the design sound good but thats largely due to how vague it is naturally we want to add the thing we need to add and remove the thing we need to remove
1 hough the team have explained their work pretty well the have not included a test plan it is an important part of the project and should be included
0 refactor the reportformatterhelper into a reportscontroller where the reportscontroller implement a strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report if that is correct then yes their explanation is great
0 the design implement all the defined functionality elaborately
0 yes the uml diagram sufficiently provide visualization
0 yes design doe include a welldescribed test plan the provided test will surely test the functionality which will be implemenedt the test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including presteps and different testing expectation great work no suggestion are required
0 the design incorporates all the required functionality to a good extent
0 no visualization required for this project
0 the doc seems complete all aspect of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included a uml diagram may prove to be useful
0 the team ha already identified the file to be changed which is a good thing it look like all change will be handled in the clientside so not applicable
0 yes it follows appropriate principle
0 the design is straightforward and a simple a possible the team ha thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowchart and mockups this ha greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chance of clutter and confusion
0 design is simple and easy to understand
1 a mentioned above the flow diagram should be completely modified
1 the author do not have a section for proposed change hence it is not completely clear which change they are proposing and which change are already existing
0 good work on adding uml diagram now the problem is very well explained
0 the design and fix are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality the issue are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fix suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner
1 team ha given information on how it will work after the the project is done could have given more detail on design using uml diagram and file invovled in the project
1 i cant find any explanation for principle and pattern maybe the author should add them to wiki
0 the change are apt and easy to follow it make sense
1 few information is missing like specification on nlp and how exactly the implementation would be idea is fine but add more detail to it
0 both the problem and proposed change are clearly detailed my only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location a the solution to it otherwise one ha to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed
0 yes the proposed change make only required addition
1 the team ha provided the application flow diagram which help to understand the working of the project it would be helpful to add design detail and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation a well
1 there are no section titled project purpose project design or testing plan however much of the information required to create those section is provided
1 the project purpose is explained with example but no design or plan to implement is given again under the test plan section a generic method is given but is not specific to the project
0 the design doe corporate all the functionality required
0 yes very well explained
0 the uml diagram mentioned her is a flow chart representing the flow of the functionality it is designed in detail which explains the flow of the functionality quite well
0 yes the project design is meaningful and clear the solution is well laid out
0 yes the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionality a stated in the problem statement
0 the picture clearly demonstrate the change being made to the system although it is apparent where the change would be visible it would be nice if a image wa posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the change would be visible
1 test plan are present but have not explained in detail a brief description of the use case with the test plan and rspec would be perfect
1 the design includes test planon the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionality but nothing mentioned on how they will write
1 the design is well though of however instead of writing the time difference logic gem could have been used which are well tested and bug free
1 the test plan can be more elaborate and complete this will help a part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made work correctly
1 the only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page more uml based diagram could increase understandability
1 the test plan seems to be fine it basically outline all the functionality that the team will test the different case the team will test is also outlined though not many i guess there will be more test case to be added once the project is on the roll
1 from the previous stage the team ha added the use case diagram that efficiently describes the actor involved in the process also since a new controller is proposed it wa essential to identify the role of the instructor
0 the design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance but not much is included for integration of review performance suggestion the topic of integration of review performance can be talked about in brief
0 the screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed
1 not enough add use case diagram and flow diagram
0 yes i think so
0 the design doc is sound and i believe no design pattern are required for this project
1 the author talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript script for further action there are no apparent problem with this strategy however i would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more detail on the implementation for example it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like how many function will be used or how they will interact with html
0 incorporates intended functionality
0 yes simple straightforward solution
1 testing plan is not included however somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the step to reproduce
0 the author have described what all change they plan to do and where they plan to do it compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tool and framework they plan to work on the design document look complete and understandable now
1 the author do not mention the model they will be making addition to i would suggest the team to consider a new controller since adding new code to an existing controller may not be oo design
0 in round one team ha well explained their approach and how are they going to do it in this round they have included detailed information and mock ui it wa easy to relate their approach their test plan is also thorough i think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new change good job guy
0 design flow look good
1 the author have put in a good amount of effort in creating lowfi sketch table of the grade summary view with mock data they have included a rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information the documentation also show the manage course view which contains the assessment icon that link to the grade summary page one suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow a a flowchart or even useful uml diagram for usecases
0 the explanation are good and the project goal are easily readable
0 wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose what change need to be made however including a mock test plan would have been better
1 there is le about what they gon na do but more about before and after part
0 great improvement compared to the previous submission now it a very well written document good job team
1 the team hasnt included any test plan in the design document i feel testing is really important in this project a there are many ifs in the usecase
0 the wiki page is very explanatory and the author have explained the issue and fix very well
0 the proposal given by the team are reasonable and adequately cover the feature to be established during the course of the project the change suggested follow the desired requirement
1 clearly defined bug and problem statement but no implementation detail given so it is hard to judge this criterion
1 the bar chart have been added to the design report the visualization have been added to view also and the screen shot have been added too the only thing that i would like to add is that the bar chart could have been more descriptive a in they could have added detail for x label and y label and also put legend this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying
1 there is a hint of visual aid in term of the section of application flow for the instructor and student and thus we can say that it doe slightly help get a sense of putting thing into perspective none both the diagram seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionality the uml diagram is in line with the convention and follows suite the diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail
0 the test plan are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into step such a presteps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve indepth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
0 clearly explained with diagram and uml diagram
1 i do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system suggestion i did not find any detail regarding about any method that will be used to implement the functionality that would have been useful the test plan doe mention viewsuggestionmetricsforreviewsegment though if this is the method name then it doe not follow snake casing
1 the author have divided the design into subtasks which show that they are very clear about their approach a per the problem statement the added functionality seems complete to me suggestion you could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work
0 the diagram are succinct and wellunderstood
0 the visual aid used are precise and explain the indepth functionality of the project the diagram and flowchart ensure there is no ambiguity in the functioning of the project
0 the explanation are more than sufficient not only have the author explained the change to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those change i like the way that they also explained the other different way they couldve integrated the github metric but avoided those method with sufficient reasoning for the samethe team ha also given an explanation of their database design modification would be like which is good
0 the visualization is great all the flow diagram and required screenshots are in place a required
0 uml look good follows the convention
1 the document doe not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mention the step to be done in order to implement the required functionality
0 the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
1 a for the design proposed by the author it prof to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of design aspect in their doc they havent even defined an application flow nothing about adding a method to any class ha been suggested a per them most important thing are going to be given in the final doc design
0 the author have explained the required change in a concise manner
1 the test plan is clear and effective but shallow manual testing is good but more description should be provided for the automated testing
0 the document is complete and very clear
1 team have decided to give all detail after final submission a design doc should be available before starting the project i would recommend to provide few detail on project design class involved in the project or application flow etc
0 yup because it only test the ability to change the language
0 the design incorporates everything that the project document ha specified about the project no suggestion
0 the design doc look complete with all of the necessary detail being covered
0 the design seems simple and clear
1 project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation however the test plan is not stated in the documentation
0 yes the design follow the principle and they have added design for each issue specifying every detail which is quite a task
0 yes the required change for the review is explained clearly the design for each required change is also explained in depth now
1 change proposed are adequate but without any reference to code or design diagram it hard to tell if the proposed solution will work it is always better to investigate the code instead of writing state such a this maybe the legacy code is in two place hence the two call
0 self explanatory visual change have been added all the change are described via the visual aid
1 could use more detail
1 no uml diagram
1 yes the design includes the test plan however the test plan could have been more low level instead of just writing it should statement
0 e the design is very simple and explains the change required in a very clear manner
1 still no visualization of any kind
0 yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
0 the team ha ha listed the file that they propose to change namely the view appviewsresponseresponsehtmlerb and the partial appviewssubmittedcontentselfreviewhtmlerb however they could have described what these file currently do and their purpose in the documentation the author have embedded screenshots of how the ui of the review page will look after the analyze button will be included they have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metric pertaining to a review namely volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric will be generated once the button is clicked
0 yes they have incorporated everything they have explained the solution a well
0 the design incorporates everything that the project document ha specified about the project no suggestion
0 yes there is a detailed test plan for this project not only basic feature testing but also other more testing
0 yes the author ha explained the scope of the project very clearly and ha specified the change to be made in the project to accomplish the goal
1 yes the design look simple the use of mock up screen is good and greatly help understand the flow that ha been proposed good work how ever in one of the flow chart the check for is admin doe not showlabel y or n path
0 the design doc doe mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different way they can implement the same
1 author ha not proposed any change
0 refactor functionality from a controller helper into it own controller where that controller will implement the strategy pattern it seems sound to me
1 maybe add some design diagram rather than just have screenshots
0 yes
0 a test plan is included in this design doc
1 the design document state all the required thing right from project design to test plan the doc also specifies what all file will be change along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed suggestion i feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate the team did mention one scenario i feel like there could have been many more but a all the required thing are present i am giving this post full star
1 did not find much info on the design
1 the team ha done a good job trying to show with picture what their change will look like in the front end no uml ha been provided
1 the team have suggested reasonable change to address the problem statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation
1 though the pull request ha been passed but the writeup doe not explain the detail of the implementation like what sorting algorithm the team ha implemented using jquery etc the design part of the writeup is very hollow and need further refinement
0 no their section solution design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
0 adequate diagram are given explanation of problem statement done well
0 all good design principle are being followed where necessary
1 make include more detail for test plan other than that the wiki look very good
0 the design doe not seem that complex the team ha clearly mentioned the issue and the way to go about it
1 the explanation are provided a point which is very easy to follow and understand though the need for the proposed ui change is not very clear to me few more detail on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful
1 the documentation look great a a highlevel design document lowlevel technical detailscode level should also be covered
1 no they didnt include any test plan in their design
0 i dont think they need any visual aid
0 yes design involves google chart api and seems very simple
1 test can be made more exhaustive for now it look like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested a well
1 havent included the test plan
0 the design look good all the issue are stated and addressed nicely
1 though this project doesnt require any uml diagram a such however a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient
0 yes the design is sound and clear majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm the team proposes to integrate this functionality into expertiza and also improve the response time this project doe not need to incorporate any design pattern a only the view file are altered the project doe not impact the degree to which it is object oriented
0 no visualization or diagram are necessary
0 yes the design appears to be good to me i believe the diagram shown in wiki helped me to understand their understanding
0 wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose what change need to be made however including a mock test plan would have been better
0 the design proposal is coherent and easy to understand the proposed design and step for solution are also logical the team have done a lot of work to think about how to solve the bug good job guy
1 this couldnt be reviewed a the design doc is incomplete
0 this team consistently us great diagram that add to their documentation clarity significantly
0 incorporates intended functionality
1 there is no description of what the team plan to implement
0 yes it incorporates all the functionality
1 team have decided to give all detail after final submission a design doc should be available before starting the project i would recommend to provide few detail on project design class involved in the project or application flow etc
0 test plan have been shown clearly and test are easy to understand
0 the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the user are student and instructor and the data base is where the action are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of review information also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so a to elucidate the problem statement
1 solution have been proposed how they are going to do that is not mentioned
0 change are well explained with good visual aid
1 the design document is easy to comprehendhave explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution
1 could not find any explanation regarding the change proposed
0 good test plan should include more test case that check the functionality of github integration eg if number of line of code committed by a student is correctly computed
0 the design appears to be very simple the team ha avoided unnecessary complication by adhereing to the rail internationalization guide they have also avoided making unnecessary change to many file and kept the change to the minimum number of file required
0 the design incorporates most of the functionality required it would be nice to have a design diagram
1 few information is missing like specification on nlp and how exactly the implementation would be idea is fine but add more detail to it
0 yes it doe
0 excellent use of visualization they already had an overall flow chart and this time additional table and uml ha been added best of what ive seen
1 the team did a good job in explaining the problem statement for each issue and providing their proposed solution the purpose of the project is clear from the document a is a composite of several independent issue the problem is that testing plan is missing from the project i would suggest starting from the most basic test case that check the functionality eg one spec per issue and then elaborating from there moreover while fixing some issue like and consists of a small modification to the existing code there are other case where the design decision are not provided and it would be better for the team to include some justification and possible discussion of design pattern the document extensively us diagram that depict application flow for each use case which is impressive
0 the author have done a very good job at writing the design document their requirement and proposed solution are properly aligned and their approach take all the factor into consideration viz listing the major area that need refactoring changing the code modifying the ui making sure that the refactoring doe not affect the existing functionality they have explained each of these phase with ample explanation
1 the document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirement which are suggested by the change request however the team may change tone of the document a it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself the team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza link of existing and ongoing change and would be more reachable to a wider audience
0 excellent use of screenshots made thing very clear for me
0 yes the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of
1 no uml diagram
1 the design incorporates all the required functionality the team could have added use case or crc card to help convey which part of code they plan to change and how overall the team conveys their objective
1 i feel the diagram is more complex team could have gone with some usecaseumlcrc diagram
0 these change seem to be appropriate for the objective they have only a small set of file are being changed and the functionality is isolated well my only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helper or utility for time tracking
1 unfortunately no visual aid are provided in the design i would suggest providing the simplified uml diagram that doe not necessarily capture all of the class that interact with the one that will be modified by the team but the one that the team find will be most relevant to the reader
0 need some diagram or prototype
0 yes the functionality is explained
1 code snippet are not mentioned but design is properly done
0 the design is straightforward and a simple a possible the team ha thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowchart and mockups this ha greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chance of clutter and confusion
1 the design document appears really easy to follow a person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document
0 the team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the webaudio api by implementing missing piece of incomplete node type oscillatornode along with entire missing node constantsourcenode stereopannernode iirfilternode
1 the change being proposed including the modification of file submission team title view reviewreport feedback report and teammate review report i think the list of modification are comprehensive but more detail need to be stated how should we change this listsubmissionshtmlerb file should we only change some line or should we change the entire pattern in which file will the sorting be implemented there doe have information on how to sort by jquery but there not yet information in term of which file which part need to be changed
1 using google chart is a good idea
1 more explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added could have also added technology to be used
0 test plan outline the functionality that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the change
1 uml diagram and the solution proposed by the author to solve the issue is missing
0 the team ha not included any additional diagram apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage the flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of action that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criterion set
0 the document is well structured and provides all required information
0 yes the design is simple and detailed thus explaining the required change that would be implemented
0 both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 the diagram is perfect and clear
0 design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good
1 all functionality required are in the design doc but no content is provided
0 the provided flowchart are visually sufficient to display the change made to the system
0 the test plan is provided in the functionality implementation describing the functionality and how it will be tested
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
1 the team hasnt included any test plan in the design document i feel testing is really important in this project a there are many ifs in the usecase
1 the design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow but the approach section doesnt have any technical implementation detail it just explains the flow that is going to be implemented test plan is missing
1 the author have not explained properly the modification that need to be made they have just written the objective
1 the project doe not have any testing involved
1 i do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system the team also ha mentioned about the api that they will use enough effort have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it suggestion no information about the method that will be implemented ha been given in the design document availability of such info would have been helpful
0 the team ha provided a flow diagram that help to infer the structural outline of the project the scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram
0 yes
1 actually they talked a little about previous work from e project and a lot about what they gon na do but it better to have some contrast
1 the explanation and the diagram dont match exactly the explanation say user should be able to see composite and peer review score only after he completes his own review that is not captured in the flow diagram else it is self explanatory
0 yes the diagram are clear to show how the system work they have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same
1 no test plan added they where missing the last time a well you guy should add them telling how you exactly plan to test the change you make even if it a small change it should be mentioned how it wa tested
1 the author have made it clear by including mockup screen of the proposed solution they have used class uml diagram for the newly identified subclass and hence i think that they have made adequate use of visual aid suggestion they can add use case for the new feature
1 the team have done a good job explaining their project but i feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more also more test case should have been included in more detail
0 the author have made a comprehensive document that clearly outline the change that they made they have included the uml diagram depicting the flow of control the design section list the file that were modified and newly created it also comprises the content of the summary sheet that get displayed once an instructor click the assessment icon lowfi ui and a prototype revealing the relevant field that are to be displayed in the grade summary
1 no their section solution design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
1 a fix for the second and fourth issue is missing at the current moment if this is included a in the other issue then the document will adequately propose solution also perhaps more elaboration on the rd fix on how the column are not being copied over i know the code is pasted but a simple worded explanation would be nice too
0 yes
1 i feel that the test section is in adequate the user have only listed scenario with no detail on how to implement that also missing are detailed step on how to execute the test if required
0 yes they have added mock ui screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do
0 the team ha added uml diagram image of related web page and provided detail on jquery tablesorter that explains well the change the team plan to make
0 uml diagram mentioned are excellent and to the mark
0 complete and wellexplained impressed by background paragraph also the screenshot of problem statement and solution is thorough
0 the design appears to be sound and wouldnt conflict with the existing class or method
0 the main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality this is a great idea it is consistent with the appropriate programming principle eg not reinventing the wheel one suggestion would be for the author to explain why the instance of the class from which the relevant part of code are going to be copied is not directly used a this would be a more dry approach in a case if this is not possible then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful
1 there are enough aid such a uml diagram and screen shot the author explicitly mention that there are no db change so no need of an er diagram although i would have liked some class level detail to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design change
0 yes easy to understand
1 the explanation seem to be okay couldnt fully understand what they meant by use proper polymorphism to handle in the problem statement part bi
0 the team already ha mockups for their design
0 yes a it sorting not much scope on design approach yet the team ha documented well on their approach regarding multilevel sorting that they are undertaking in few page they have also considered crossbrowser compatibility of their jquery library which is a common design miss during clientside change
0 the design ha a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise
0 well explanation on problem statement uml diagram flow chart given detailed explanation on problem statement
0 the design document is very thorough indicating whats the problem how system work and proposed soluion
1 no diagram included in the document adding some diagram to explain what the system is and how the design will look like will be better
0 design seems good
1 did not find much info on the design
1 how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use
0 test plan is to be added but the purpose and the design are coherent and easy to follow
0 i understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system
1 the test plan can be more elaborate and complete this will help a part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made work correctly
1 no visuals at all
0 the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objective that need to be achieved the team explains well the purpose and project design they have included the database table which will be modified the team could add a testing plan to make the design document look complete
1 the test plan doesnt seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation it simply give direction for running test
0 the use of visualization is not pivotal for this task a it can be explained theoretically a well but still the team ha made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram
1 no there is not any chart
1 yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow a it give the which functionality must be test but doesnt mention it inform of test like what should be the action taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test case in form of context and it statement
0 yes the author have clearly explained the change to be made to the system document is simple succinct and easy to understand great use of flow chart uml diagram and mockups to visually represent the information is done
0 a per the requirement document test case are not required
0 i am able to understand the purpose of the project
1 design document explains the entire project flow very well the objectivesgoals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in futurethe flowchart explains the functionality very well overall the doc is easy to understand suggestion team should include test plan in the doc
0 yes only a few file are being modified
0 the design contains all of the functionality required
1 few test plan is written the team can add more test plan
1 the problem statement is not clear
0 yes the design appears to be sound and well made
1 the current test written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner case a wel such a what happens if the deadline for selfreview is exceeded doe that mean the peerreview score can not be seen or is a default score of is set
0 yes the design is robust and simple to understand each class and view only handle a specific functionality ie it is modularised
0 the test plan look really thorough covering all the possible scenario i am personally happy with the given testplan
0 the design is sound with appropriate principle and pattern
1 the document is really descriptive about what work need to be done however i would suggest them to properly structure the document one find it really difficult to understand the flow of the document
0 the design wa not unnecessarily complex it wa a easy a it could be
0 the design document is good and i dont think any design pattern need to be followed a very few change are being made
0 yes the design seems to be sound
0 the document show the flow of work really wellhowever i would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tool and technology that will be used this will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent
1 the team ha proposed many change although it is not clear which approach or what exact change they plan to make
0 the design look good the code is already committed and approved by the concerned team good job
0 no visulization is necessary for this project
1 no uml diagram included in the document please include application flow diagram state diagram or sequence diagram or use case diagram to make the document for readable
1 visualization offer only a flow chart but other uml diagram like class diagram would have been more helpful
1 could have been more descriptive
0 according to the solution suggested team should be able to implement it
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 yes almost everything seems perfect only a little more explaination is required
0 using a strategy pattern to solve this problem is one of the simplest approach according to me and team ha selected the same thing only thing i would suggest the team is to be carefull when separating the class a it might have some unintended side affect
0 yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
1 the modification that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the change that are necessary for the javascript library to work while it is possible to infer the majority of change that will be introduced in this project it would be better if the author elaborated on the implementation of all the view a opposed to discussing only the view submission table
0 the wiki is detailed enough that it mention all the functionality required in the project the team ha made sure to explain all the change they wish to make to the system they list all column that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting
1 did not find any diagram in the wiki
1 testing plan is not included however somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the step to reproduce
0 a the project is based upon making change to the ui of the system thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionality that they need to implement
0 yes the document seems to be perfect it doe follow all the appropriate principle and pattern no suggestion required
0 i dont see any issue in the design document they have followed a good design principle
0 the uml class diagram help to understand the report involved their attribute and functionality it provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different report
0 yes their doc ha adequately explained the change
1 the author have explained well regarding their design approach to support hindi language but it ha not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another language in the future i think they can mention if their design can accomodate other language easily or not
0 the design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objective the test plan indicates what aspect are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted
0 their solution sound good
0 using the report interface to assist with specialization wa good
0 i think that the author have identified change in the htmlerb file which look right to me a it only deal with the sorted view of instructor report the change must go in the view part of the application suggestion you can try to add a bit of information on whether your change include addition of new code deletion of existing code or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it query do you plan on creating a dropdown like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed if yes it is an addon userfriendly feature
1 their design are great but some design may be complicated
0 design appears to be good
1 seems like all part of the design document need more detail
1 the project purpose and possible solution are clearly described in this design doc however the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solution also there is no testing plan
0 yes they have well explained their design
1 yes all the functionality including viewing submission viewing score viewing review report author feedback report teammate review report are all available i believe a more intuitive detailed explanation or description might be even more useful while describing the functionality in the design here such design is still just simply stated a the project goal
1 test plan are present but have not explained in detail a brief description of the use case with the test plan and rspec would be perfect
0 yes and at time much more than necessary
0 the author have explained enough about the change
0 yes the author have nicely explained the change to be made this includes the flow diagram uml diagram and many of the screenshots good work team suggestion could include screenshots if any of the test plan implemented
1 lower level design change are missing author have only talked about config change no mention if the db requires any change
1 this is a mozilla project and i am not sure what are the testing requirement and depth to be covered a it is not mentioned in the document but the step mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done
0 the explanation given is quite easy to understand and explains the solution to the point
0 i dont have any issue with the design looking forward to seeing some code snippet to understand it better
0 the requirement were distilled down to the fewest simple term possible without overgeneralization it felt like they just gave me the tldr statement without any fluffy word to waste my time and also feel like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish
1 the application flow help understands how your design work but maybe you can add more visual aid to help understand your design more easily
0 the design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lot of method of searching
1 yes the functionality are present it would have been good if the issue were listed sequentially following it solution
0 it list out all the functionality in the problem solution and look very clear and very elaborate with code and diagram
0 the design doe include test plan and plan to test the functionality
1 the visualization includes a screen mockup analyze button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output however there is no mockup of the screen of what will the output be like the flow diagram is highly redundant according to me a it doe not portray any additional information about the design i would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm method so a to illustrate their change
1 the explanation are done well but they could be more thorough why is the internationalization api and google translate needed also will you use a script to edit the view how would you do that it seems like too much work to do manually
1 no change proposed
0 yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
1 yes the database design and flowchart give a clear picture what system will do after the required change suggestion add before after change screen mockups to your document
1 yes the design includes a test plan i think the test can be more descriptive including what is being tested and in which scenario the test is being implemented
1 the writeup is very minimal i think it should elaborate made
0 the design appears to be very simple the team ha avoided unnecessary complication by adhereing to the rail internationalization guide they have also avoided making unnecessary change to many file and kept the change to the minimum number of file required
0 simple and easy to understand step
0 the design doc submitted is pretty neat and contains all the necessary information to understand the requirement of the project
0 design document look complete with problem statement file that need to be modified a lofi diagram to indicate the flow
0 yes easy to understand
0 they explained from their requirement and in their flow that they only need to plan to edit the view so there is no need for a uml
0 the project ha great visualization a lot of uml diagram have been included which make the understanding the project easier the uml diagram also clarifies what work is to be done
1 the design look good but from the implementation detail given and the amount of use case listed i feel there could be some more implementation detail that are left out
1 the autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggynot sure if it is in the scope of this project so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of interval like min
1 although the writeup explains the thing clearly visual aid will leverage your proposed change suggestion you can include uml diagram like use case application flow to elaborate more on your additional change you can mock the change editing html page to show proposed change which will really help in a better understanding of your design
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the review section
0 test case have been added
1 yes the design is simple however a stated above it is very succinct and abstract only which file are going to be edited are written what methodsinterfaces will be modified is not mentioned
1 the design document ha the required design and implementation plan however it isnt uploaded a a wiki but a a pdf this can be inconvenient for grading and is also a lot harder to modify for the team
1 the author have explained the change to be made to the system including screenshots of the table uml diagram a well a all the file that will be modified suggestion although all the detail are explained well in the document by writing the change proposed to the file in bullet point or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read
1 i think the diagram shown include where you intend to add the metric but not how all the metric will be incorporated in the next phase make sure to include detail for each of these total number of commits number of file changed line of code added line of code modified line of code deleted locs that survived until final submission exclude from mvp due to the complexity and lower priority
0 the design look almost complete in term of solutionwise detail covered
1 organization of the document is missing it quote a problem statement present a flowchart and state a pair of objectivesolutions yet again from this write up i could understand that theyre trying to do thing log the time that each review take by improving an earlier project autosave review and merge data of detail page on report page i can not find these clearly separated
0 yes the design appears to be sound and well made
0 just overview is presented which is explained properly the technical design is not explained in depth
1 author ha not proposed any change
1 screenshots are added which are enough to tell what they will be doing in the front end a bit more can be explained on backend part by giving code snippet
0 very clear very well organized
1 no it doesnt suggestion team should add a test plan which includes test for testing the required change
0 please add more information on the nlp algorithm team is trying to use
0 the design is pretty straightforward and i am able to get a complete idea of what change the team intend to make
1 it state the internal jquery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting again more detail on implementation are required to be documented to ass the quality of the solution
0 the team ha added uml diagram image of related web page and provided detail on jquery tablesorter that explains well the change the team plan to make
0 yes everything is incorporated
0 test plan is included but it make many reference to manual test the test they state could be automated in a straight forward manner
0 the explanation are good and the project goal are easily readable
1 no all functionality are not incorporated design and implement a solution that handle github is missing
0 i could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the google doc containing the list of problem statement but on reading the team design documentation on the wiki page im quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include in addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team ha also proposed a nonfunctional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it take to generate the suggestion through the web service
0 a stated above all the reference need to be checked a signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency
0 the flow diagram is good make understanding easier
1 the document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirement which are suggested by the change request however the team may change tone of the document a it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself the team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza link of existing and ongoing change and would be more reachable to a wider audience
0 they are trying to leverage the existing screen and adding additonal fucntionality thus it wouldnt impact the existing code
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the review section
1 the team ha discussed their plan using flowchart but they have not used any class diagram
0 the design appears to be sound considering the expected outcome of the project and it doesnt seem that it will create any dependency mismatch a well
0 a approach described by the author design appears to be the simplest it is concise and easy to understand
0 design seems correct
0 the author have explained the change to be made to the system including screenshots of the table uml diagram a well a all the file that will be modified suggestion although all the detail are explained well in the document by writing the change proposed to the file in bullet point or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read
0 the wiki documentation is extremely well written with all change explained clearly and concisely the good thing about this wiki is that the proposed solution section is brilliantly explained the team have clearly mentioned all filename where they propose to make change drawn diagram to illustrate the flow control and added snippet of code where necessary brilliant
0 uml diagram mentioned are excellent and to the mark
0 this their design is very simple and clear
0 change are well explained with good visual aid
0 yes uml diagram is provided and it is detailed flow diagram explains how suggestion will be given
1 the change are not yet proposed
1 the design doc for now specifies only the issue no approach ha been given yet on prospective solution
1 all good component of a design document are present it would be nice to have the ui mockups without handwriting that may make it hard to read
0 the team already ha mockups for their design
0 lot of great visualization are provided that outline a good amount of detail
0 the visualization provided in the form of flow diagram in very easy to understand however er diagram of main db table could have been provided because it is difficult to understand the data flow and inter relation between table
0 great use of mock ups really appreciate it
0 yes the author have adequately explained all the change that need to be made each issue ha a separate list of change to be made and which file need to be edited
0 duplicating code and fixing it for the new implementation is an effective strategy but not very dry and could result in code that is hard to maintain read and test
0 the design look perfect it is neither overly simple nor it is too complicated
1 it isnt clear what all the review statistic will be shown in the column if it is just the time spent then thats fine but if there are other detail a well then it need to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell wo affecting readability
1 what is wrong with the current implementation is clearly not stated
0 actual project work ha not started yet so code modification have not been mentioned however the file to be changed seem appropriate
1 the author have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution which clarifies how their solution will look like however the use of visual aid seems to be inadequate since they have not added any class diagram usecase or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth suggestion you might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern a suggested above to improvise your writeup
0 the test plan is complete and cover all intended functionality they have also provided all necessary step to test the functionality good documentation on test plan a clientside change using script is added a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included
1 nothing specified
1 there is no visual aid
1 the problem statement could have been elaborated a bit more one line doesnt seem enough here
0 the change proposed for the class performance is adequate and explains the file to be changed what change from the controller perspective and view perspective no particular suggestion proposed
0 two graph provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be more diagram would have been helpful
0 yes it doe they have given the proposed solution which appears to be simple
0 change are explained well suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it probably some code snippet would help explaining that
0 the author have explained all the change to be made very clearly and concisely each change is supplemented with sufficient diagram and mockups so a to make the final task of visualization easier
0 the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test case that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
1 it doe list out all the functionality but there seem to be no solution for them only a basic layout is present an insight into the solution to be implemented would be suggested
0 the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
0 yes the design in it current form seems straight forward
0 yes the design is very simple lucid and efficient
1 the actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modification have not been mentioned but the file to be modified seem appropriate
0 very well explained solution with lofi sketch
1 they didnt add the code change detail or the file in which they might work thats still fine a those detail can be filled once the implementation is done
1 the current document doe not include a visualization tool inclusion of such a tool would have made the document more readable nevertheless the link to the wiki of the previous document includes a flow diagram that clearly outline the code flow of how the control flow from the incorporation of offscreencanvas web idl file to it rust implementation in offscreencanvasrs to the dom implementation and finally to the renderer
0 yes
0 some more specific detail could be added
1 there is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation
1 they have listed various possibility to get the task done the use case and uml diagram also help here suggestion please add the place where you want to makehave made the change
1 the change are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make change only suggestion would be to include more about how these change are going to be done
0 yes there is no mention of design pattern yet but overall design appear very clear to me
0 they made clear explanation about their task for example their provide picture to show what they need to do
1 the document mention the problem statement and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it there is no reference to code or function that might need some modification some design talk would be nice
0 design seems correct
1 not very well lack of the use case
0 the design is a simple a it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity the change also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principle
0 the design doc is well written and the point to be completed are clearly expressed
1 the introduction wa a little confusing a to what this team is going to do rather the objective of the project section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that i wa able to understand what already exists the objective of the project section contains the proposed solution when the proposed solution ought to be a separate section
0 for a difficult a problem a linking assignment from one year to the next is they present an admirably simple design
0 visual aid are very nice especially for the flow diagram
0 yes design doc cover all of the functionaliites
1 the explanation is good and they have managed to get in a prototype ui a well my only concern with the design is if there are a lot of assignment the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user
0 yes one of the best design doc of project
1 the team ha well explained what are they going to change though i didnt get how are they going to do the proposed change since they are going to introduce a new feature they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature
1 would be good to include high level overview of change made in the file
1 application flow is present and done well uml diagram need to be added
0 implementation look just like what the requirement asked for no removing of english code
0 yes the test coverage seems good
0 the test cover all the required functionality and a it is mentioned controller test make more sense than unit test
0 explanation are very clear and simple to understand
1 it fine i have the gist of it but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the project description the uml is a nice touch albeit super bare
0 yes the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case maybe the author could specify the pattern they use in the document
0 the design document is well planned and doe not miss any of the significant detail
0 yes excellent work done by the team the design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like there are enough detail to in the document to understand what is being done and what change are proposed the document also ha enough illustration on what is the current situation
0 the test plan is thorough
0 yes the explanation provided for change to be made are clearly mentioned the author are very clear what and where to make change use of flowchart make reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily suggestion no test plan is included in the project
0 since the project is aimed at fixing the issue no design pattern need to be used
0 the design make it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal the author have made it a point to describe the task carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue
0 yes the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear they also provide some diagram to explain their project which is helpful
0 the provided flowchart are visually sufficient to display the change made to the system
0 the visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to expertiza
0 this team did not require any test
0 good use of both diagram and table
1 the author have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an er diagram however the diagram is a little high level and doe not completely explain the flow of the system
0 yes they have explained it very well
0 the design is very clear and help in better understanding the flow of the system
0 system is well defined
0 in the uml diagram the set of action that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added also add the action to modify the display sequence of existing question in the instructor flowchart the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing question is missing
1 the writeup show very little since the work ha not yet been started therefore it doe not clearly incorporates what all functionality will be required however there are some mentioned in proposed change area
0 the design look good all the issue are stated and addressed nicely
1 yes the design is pretty good the pattern followed avoids any duplication of code but i had made a suggestion in review one to take a look at project and it code the problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused i dont see any mention of it i hope you do take a look before starting to code a it will avoid any rework
1 the design document is good which cover every aspect from project purpose to the test case however there are some thing which i found incomplete in the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition of what is meant by self review a the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the ui aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed
0 yes the author have nicely explained the change to be made good work team
1 the design appears to be fairly simple i think however there will be difficulty in implementing the github metric for latest data v data before the submission deadline
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission no design were added in the documentation
1 the proposed solution sound good they havent really mentioned the change in turn of programmer language i couldnt visualize how are they going to make change they have mentioned few htmlerb file but i think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature i think the team could have been more precise in their approach for example they could have included what all new method they need to add or modify the existing one
1 the wireframes themselves make the project selfexplanatory that being said enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement ha been given thing like what api will be used to achieve the objective ha been mentioned no suggestion
0 author have clearly explained all the change to be made and where to make them the design document is quite clear and easy to understand
0 the design is extremely simple and easy to understand good work guy
0 yes their explanation are adequately explained the change
1 the design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow but the approach section doesnt have any technical implementation detail it just explains the flow that is going to be implemented test plan is missing
0 i could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the google doc containing the list of problem statement but on reading the team design documentation on the wiki page im quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include in addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team ha also proposed a nonfunctional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it take to generate the suggestion through the web service
0 they have used uml diagram and flowchart which aided in understanding their approach and the logic
0 they show their design page a their visual aid and their are helpful for reader to understand what their design look like
1 the author have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using they have mentioned the file that need to be modified
1 havent included the test plan
1 there are no visual aid to support the documenti would suggest them to design a flow chart that can show their design planning
0 yes it doe they have explained the propose solution a well for each issue
1 i think technical design lack detail the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work where will the string be kept what are the effective change required across the project test plan should have more test
1 the author do not talk much about the technical aspect of how they are going to implement their work the new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track however not much research is done till now
1 the uml diagram are missing but they are compensated by suitable explanation i could follow it very easily
0 the provided flow diagram and db table are enough the explain the functionality of the project
1 yes their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project but how the team will achieve the few not so straightforward sorting such a the one indicated in author feedback report is not clear to conclude their approach will achieve the intended functionality
0 yes all of them are implemented with good quality of explanation
0 yes their section method to calculate composite score and application flow section have a flow chart a well a at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon
1 i find the information and solution provided inadequate a they fail to explain me the solution also missing diagram
0 the design appears to be very simple the team ha avoided unnecessary complication by adhereing to the rail internationalization guide they have also avoided making unnecessary change to many file and kept the change to the minimum number of file required
0 very good explanation and good work on giving alternative it would have been great if the team had added db design a well but the work done is sufficient
0 yes test are explained thoroughly with written code
0 the use of flowchart describe the functioning of the project exceptionally suggestion including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it
0 explained in detail which is very good
0 includes everything a far a i can tell
0 yes the diagram clearly illustrate the proposed flow different diagram are provided for different issue one of the best wikis i have seen
0 very simple and clear
0 they have depicted their working strategy through an er diagram however i would suggest them to include more uml diagram to enhance understandability also the er diagram is somewhat incomplete
1 need to edit test plan and add more test case
1 yes design seems fit more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented
0 the design is a simple a possible and described in a straightforward manner
0 they explained their plan very well both the visual aid and the word they use are very clear
1 i feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge case
1 yes they do incoroporate but very bad look and feel of the document and hard to understand
0 yes a it sorting not much scope on design approach yet the team ha documented well on their approach regarding multilevel sorting that they are undertaking in few page they have also considered crossbrowser compatibility of their jquery library which is a common design miss during clientside change
0 change look good
1 the visualization aid used are class diagram for the strategy pattern usecases to explain the test plan the class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team and it succeeds in explaining they have made change according to the suggestion provided in the previous review a sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the method from one controller to the other a the design suggests so
0 yes the design follows appropriate principle and pattern suggestion not required
1 the team ha an outline of the test plan and the test scenario which they are planning to take care of it would be suggested that the team take care of all the exhaustive scenario which are related to the functionality they could also add the step wise description of the scenario they have mentioned or the test case they are planning to implement test driven approach make sure our code is exhaustive of all scenario
1 provided link is not the wiki link not a good documentation
0 the test plan is thorough and contains lot of detail that will make it easy to design rspec test in the future
0 document look complete
0 yes the design is very simple to understand and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective
0 good design principle are being used for this project
1 no design found on the wiki not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the change can be helpful
1 yes the github api integration look good the only part missing wa perhaps they could have documented the rest call that they are going to make in the document a well usage of existing gem is good and eas lot of implementation pain
1 the author have explained well on what change they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented a i had suggested in my previous review they can mention the expertiza file controller view involved
1 the design document ha incorporated test plan but they havent been explained neatly only the skeleton for the test ha been provided theyve should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify
0 it is clear and simple
0 the project doe not have any testing involved
1 the design document give a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test case or what would be tested
0 yes the document includes a test plan there wa no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionality
0 yes the plan seems simple and feasible
0 they have pretty good test plan a there is no code yet
0 the explainations are succinct the description in technical design section and beforeafter image clearly show what the project intends to do
0 yes the required functionality is adequately explained good work in that
0 the design ha been explained in a simple way the team ha explained the design using use case which is easy to comprehend
0 clear understanding of what need to be done
0 yes well designed document ui mockups given it is structured
0 the design seems to be following the appropriate principle and us the appropriate guideline they usecase diagram mention each actor and the role associated
0 design document explains the entire project flow very well the objectivesgoals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in futurethe flowchart explains the functionality very well overall the doc is easy to understand suggestion team should include test plan in the doc
0 they have explained in detail about the proposed change with individual diagram for each case it is very thorough in explanation
1 there is no description of what the team plan to implement
1 the design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow there are no section for project purpose project design or project testing consider adding these section to give order to the document also red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some
0 the design includes a brief test plan that list three scenario namely the regular step to update course page to hindi checking if edit assignment page ha also been translated and checking if other page are translated some more test case like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included the author specify that rspec and capybara is used for testing the new feature
0 yes the provided diagram deliver sufficient information about the implementation
0 the team ha completed the implementation and have included the screenshots of the rspec code that test the assessmentcontrollerrb and specifically the coursestudentgradesummary method they test whether the instance variable provided in the view have been properly instantiated without concerning too much about the value that they hold they back this up with a link to ruby best practice guide for functional test for controller plus they include feature test to check whether correct detail are displayed they have also justified the reason for not performing unit test a they dont alter the model the highlight of this document is the video link showing the test performed kudos to the team for the effort
0 explanation is quite easy to understand
1 implementation detail are missing but the testing plan is ready
0 this wiki is dope they analyze the requirement for the github metric they would need and walked the reader through their design consideration it seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project
1 the design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly
1 yes the design is pretty good the pattern followed avoids any duplication of code but i had made a suggestion in review one to take a look at project and it code the problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused i dont see any mention of it i hope you do take a look before starting to code a it will avoid any rework
1 the purpose of the project seems quite clear the team ha explicitly mentioned all the requirement that ha been expected of them along with the way to implement said requirement there is no testing plan however they should include that and then the document would be good to go
0 yes design seems fit more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented
0 the class diagram is very useful and the mock ui with indication on it make it more useful
0 the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the logical flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the proposed design section so a to elucidate the problem statement
0 the design document is well planned and doe not miss any of the significant detail
0 the author have listed all the proposed change in the problem solution i wa able to understand it without any trouble overall quality of the proposal is good
0 ui mockups and uml diagram are descriptive however more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem
0 the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
1 the test plan is clear and effective but shallow manual testing is good but more description should be provided for the automated testing
0 the design contains all of the functionality required
1 the project is complete and sound enough in it approach and the implementation and the test plan ha been well devised and just shy of application even so in their project they lack two section of key note ie one is the project design and the solution approach
1 the explanation of change is good enough that it state what all need to be addedreimplemented but it doe not elaborate on some technical aspect
0 looking at the doc it seems like the design is precise the description of the change are provided in detail ensuring the satisfaction of the reader
0 they author have used visual aid to their benefit even though they could have added a flow diagram the wire frame and other screenshots they have used serve the purpose and add to the clarity of the explanation
0 yes it look simple based on the code snippet they have given and by the diagram
0 yes this team ha made the best use of visualization tool that can be applied to their project they have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the analyze button next to each rubric the document also includes the flow of the project represented a uml diagram once the analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm the api return the response which contains the suggestion metric like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestion chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop word
1 the project design and project purpose part are pretty detailed however for the test part the author only state that they will write test for the new controller but no detailed test plan
1 mostly yes but the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagram
0 yes the author have adequately explained all the change that need to be made each issue ha a separate list of change to be made and which file need to be edited
0 they have worked on their weak point earlier their solution doe not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
0 the explanation provided are granular and do not leave any lingering question in the reader mind
0 i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who ha a test plan like this
1 no implementation proposed in the design document only placeholder need more detail for it
0 the team ha not mentioned about how they are planning to do the change
1 although the writeup explains the thing clearly visual aid will leverage your proposed change suggestion you can include uml diagram like use case application flow to elaborate more on your additional change you can mock the change editing html page to show proposed change which will really help in a better understanding of your design
1 a stated above the team ha not explained any design pattern they are following however they have mentioned all the code change they are making for this functionality implementation the code snippet they have included is very useful to understand the exact code change they are making and the file which are getting impacted this would help the future developer to understand the code in a simple manner
0 yes the design incorporates all the functionality that are required
1 the author need to provide more detailed procedure about how they going to implement their solution instead of the result after they done it
1 the explanation for change are just an overview of what need to be done and doe not focus on the change to be made in the file
0 the test case cover all of the functionality that they are going to implement
0 the author provide some screenshots which make their project more clear it would be better if they provide more diagram to explain their solution
1 the design document wa clear and concise however i would like to see more detail on how routesrb and the view will be edited to pull static string from the enyml file the test plan section is not detailed enough
0 yes the design is appropriate
1 the autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggynot sure if it is in the scope of this project so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of interval like min
0 the author have provided a mockup of their final design which seems pretty good however whats missing is uml diagram something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful
1 the write up couldve been organized in a better manner and the author couldve given more attention to detail for example i see they mention the project e but without a hyperlink it wa a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project the search bar didnt help matter too it couldve been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented and what improvement this one doe also the document doe not cover testing even some basic test case a little formatting inconsistency the heading flowchart always ha a colon attached to it but none of the other heading do
0 the design document includes flow chart uml diagram and screenshots which is really impressive a it made the document easier to understand
0 yes look clean any design pattern used
0 the er diagram is very well done it encompasses all the class and their attribute also the use of different shape like diamond square etc is great
1 yes author have done well to explain the change being done in the project i think i wish they would have added is the detail of language they are supporting also they do mention that they will add extra column to language table they could have pasted the new schema in the doc
0 the team ha provided flow chart that explain the working of the system the team ha provided flowchart for each issue which is commendable
0 the design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project howeverit would also be nice to know what feature would be tested in the test plan
0 drastic improvement have been made to design doc
0 use of flowchart and step by step explanation simplified their solution it wa easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple
0 yes the design is sound and appeopriate however it may be better to implement more code level design
0 the design is simple
0 yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current expected state and uml diagram showing the flow diagram it depicts that once the analyze button is clicked the request is sent a json which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the api which generates the suggestion metric the response contains the suggestion metric like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestion chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop word
0 the use of visualization is not pivotal for this task a it can be explained theoretically a well but still the team ha made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram
0 the diagram that are provided in the document visualize the workflow of different actor that pertain to the given issue they are definitely helpful for the reader to understand the scope of the problem that is being addressed
0 the team ha made a great effort to explain the design through a uml diagram and screenshots of how the feature will work when added to the existing project
0 the document is complete the author have mentioned each functionality in detail also the test plan in explained thoroughly
0 the design doc is clean and neat it specifies the issue and prospective solution which are easy to follow
0 the explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objective
0 yes they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the way in which they are going to test the various edge case for the various issue at hand
0 the explanation given is quite easy to understand and explains the solution to the point
0 it explains in an overall sense what the issue is and how it going to be solved
0 design is good
1 the uml diagram doe seems to be a bit at a high level i couldnt get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented
0 yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagram illustrate the flow of control very well
0 clearly explained with diagram and uml diagram
0 yes design is informative change proposal is detailed it describes well about how change are to be implemented
0 yes the design is clear and the detail are succinct
1 the team ha added the mock up screen which help to understand the proposed look and feel of the project implementation however there are no uml diagram or design diagram added for the project due to which it difficult to understand their approach on fixing the issue
1 the test plan section is included however only the framework to be used is discussed i would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test case they plan to include and work on
0 the test plan is completed just one suggestion that it can be more specific for example it may include some real test case
0 look like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution good job
0 the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualization
1 the ui mockups uploaded are very unclear a they are just picture of hand drawn design this too could have worked had the diagram and the text inside them been clear i can understand the flow however the component are tough to decipher
0 the screenshots of the expected result and the uml diagram are good but the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more userfriendly the uml diagram can be better if it designed a a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram which simply state how the reader is to approach this or it could be better if we have both
1 yes the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of
1 yes the flow diagram and graph plot help to understand the change and it implication the diagram clearly describe the change approach followed
1 the team ha clearly defined the objective of the project the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review the only thing the team could have added wa to create a uml diagram defining the class that are changed or added and adding what attribute are added and what function modifiedadded the team havent mentioned any design pattern a such but the proposed plan explains the idea well
1 the test plan section is included however only the framework to be used is discussed i would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test case they plan to include and work on
0 yes the design is quite simple and easy to understand the author have taken a straightforward approach to implement the feature
1 the team have written a test plan but i feel more test case could have been written to test the edge case also the team could have explained their test case in more detail
0 yes
0 the author have dine a good job of detailing the issue at hand and their proposed solution uml diagram like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design
1 there is an er diagram help the reviewer understand the relationship between different set maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar etc
0 the implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rail guideline and doe seem to follow the dry principle
1 maybe add some design diagram rather than just have screenshots
1 the author can add the project purpose why this feature is importanthelpful the author have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jquery to sort the table but no design plan is included i suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it wa clearly mentioned in the requirement to not include it
0 well the proposed solution look satisfactory
1 the writeup show very little since the work ha not yet been started therefore it doe not clearly incorporates what all functionality will be required however there are some mentioned in proposed change area
1 the design seems appropriate to the issue at hand
0 can not find test plan
1 this is one area where the author could have improved even though there is a good amount of textual description and image the author could have added a snapshot of the code change that they wanted to propose this would make it clear a to the exact change that you propose and further help answer this question
0 the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the user are student and instructor and the data base is where the action are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of review information also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so a to elucidate the problem statement
0 yes it look sound
1 make include more detail for test plan other than that the wiki look very good
1 there were no flow or uml diagram
0 they have used the design pattern well and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram however im not quite sure whether it right to call the diagram a a uml diagram
1 there is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation
1 the team ha very well explained the goal and separation of concern the team could have proposed a way to test the implementation
0 change are not proposed to a suitable extent a they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement it yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit detail their action plan to arrive at the solution
0 the document doe not go much into the technical detail the limited detail provided sound right however more research will generate better understanding
1 one flow chart and one chart graph are included i find the chart incomplete and confusing too i wasnt able to relate how this is going to help real scenario the better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class program
1 no plan or uml design is given
1 a there are ui change test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
1 no they didnt use any visualization
0 yes the flow diagram and graph plot help to understand the change and it implication the diagram clearly describe the change approach followed
0 the flowchart included in the design document clearly explain the change that need to be done
1 the design seems pretty good the only drawback is the test plan is missing
0 the author have very well explained the problem statement and the change to be made to the system including flowchart the file to be modifiedadded and useful link
0 yes the design appears to be sound and follows ruby principle no code ha been repeated and they are using pre written function in many place instead of just writing the logic again good work
1 uml is missing but er diagram is given you can add a uml diagram it explains thing better
1 yes the design is the simplest i could think about but it doesnt include how to change the file i think it can still be a simple and succinct if the modification of file can be included on the other hand the expected result seems to be too long there too many screenshots
0 yes based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple a possible
1 there is a test plan for part one of the problem state however no implementation plan or test plan for part two
0 yes the deisgn appears to be totally sound the change proposed are very standardized and follows appropriate industry standard
0 the test plan are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into step such a presteps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve indepth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
0 the uml diagram is great which is clear and easy to understand
0 the design is a simple a it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity the change also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principle
0 they have used uml diagram and flowchart which aided in understanding their approach and the logic
0 yes their visualization is good they are clear and well described the change
1 included a kind of mock uilofi diagram to shown how the uiwould like which is great
1 no diagram provided
0 the use case appear to offer a quality general test approach to see if their design doe what it should
1 yes the design includes a very good test plan the test are deep and detailed and completely test the functionality but i think it could be better following the dry principle if the tester dont need to log in a administrator every time
1 they have listed various possibility to get the task done the use case and uml diagram also help here suggestion please add the place where you want to makehave made the change
1 the uml diagram is having the correct content but need the rough name of class method
0 uml look good explains whats happening
1 just one er diagram add use case and activityflow diagram
1 it precise but some information missing
0 very clear
1 no plan provided can not comment
0 yes they do explain everything the er diagram use case diagram relevant table explain everything
0 the use case uml diagram image of related page and view prototype make it easier to understand the team plan to make required change to the system
0 an appropriate test plan is included in this design doc
0 the author have explained the change made to the system the design flow greatly help to understand the flow of the system
0 the design doe appear to be a simple a possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
1 although screenshots are available on the project page it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too
1 team ha given information on how it will work after the the project is done could have given more detail on design using uml diagram and file invovled in the project
1 their design are great but some design may be complicated
0 the team ha included all the detail required to implement the given requirement the wiki ha complete detail related to requirement analysis of current design and change required to achieve the required functionality overall great job the team did a great work in analyzing the issue and designing solution for the issue the ui mock ups are included for all the issue which make the document very easy to understand
0 yes they did
0 design document ha all the necessary information like project design test plan the team ha gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation also they have included code snippet which show thoroughness of their approach
1 yes the presence of use case diagram and flow chart explaining the work flow is good it would be nice if there were more uml diagram such a sequence so show various class interaction presence of mockup screen is good that help in understanding what is being implemented it would have been good if the author put in more detail about the validation that that propose in the system
1 they have test plan but i dont think they include test in it they just put some example about how to run their code
0 this wiki is dope they analyze the requirement for the github metric they would need and walked the reader through their design consideration it seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project
0 i dont exactly understand how the waveform help to produce the sound for the new browser theyre adding support for but other than that their approach seems solid
1 the team ha not mentioned about how they are planning to do the change
1 the change proposed by the author are elaborate overall they have defined the change extensively however the search for review section could have elaborated more about the search functionality the author could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately
0 the design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well
0 yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the change made to the system
0 the explanation is decent and comprehensible
0 the change proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart stacked or single based upon the project description it is advised that the team look for other alternative like pie chart that would help to span the result with a minimal look
0 not required for this project
0 for now explainations are in preliminary state im hoping that team will fillout this a they progress in project
0 the explanation can be more detailed overall understandable
0 the design incorporates all the functionality that need to be implemented no suggestion are required
1 yes they have been thorough in their approach and this ha been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagram and the like but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the uml diagram for review section
0 diagram are explanatory but few but i think they are sufficient
0 the uml diagram included here is a flow chart diagram which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow
1 there are no diagram present it would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram wa given
0 the problem and the change needed is explained clearly
1 so far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right directionhowever not much research is done so far i would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technology they plan to use work
1 the explanation are good separating case to case and discus them one by one is a good strategy however none of them is explained in detail they are all a little bit terse after reading it i still have the following question how to change the listsubmissionshtmlerb what are the function that is already implemented the four case in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not the feature a understood from the past project is that assign grade is present for all team standardize the functionality i did not quite understand this sentence whats it relation too the four case proposed here the problem of response controllder check time and should be reduced to there not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation
1 the team ha discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but ha not proposed any design for their approach
1 no detail of the proposed design
1 code level implementation detail are not provided but the approach look clean
1 the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the wiki the wiki contains mock visualization which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do the design flow a a flow chart add to the ease of understanding the test plan explains about the technology that they are planning to use for testing suggestion the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technology to be used for a particular part of code for ed we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graph output the visualization correctly if the sum id being counted to of the class participation etc the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding
0 yes the design is having also the functionality that is been required it mention also mention a proper proposed solution for all the required task
0 they clearly understand this software design process and expertiza than me so i trust their judgement
0 the explanation is pretty good i particularly found the image explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive
1 yes the design is appropriate it would be better if the author list the pattern they are going to use
0 includes all the functionality
0 all the design look reasonable right now
0 the design wa well explained in this design doc
0 the team have a well written design document and and the author have explained the proposed change well the author have also listed each file they are going to be changed
0 the author ha explained extensively about the change to be made to the system
0 they have pretty good test plan a there is no code yet
0 there is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc
0 the test case seem appropriate given that the only thing which need to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not
1 the approach is clear but is not clear a to what change will be needed in the system
0 good work good documentation
0 their design is simple and clear
1 the change being proposed including the modification of file submission team title view reviewreport feedback report and teammate review report i think the list of modification are comprehensive but more detail need to be stated how should we change this listsubmissionshtmlerb file should we only change some line or should we change the entire pattern in which file will the sorting be implemented there doe have information on how to sort by jquery but there not yet information in term of which file which part need to be changed
0 proper design a well a test feature are mentioned
0 the author have explained the required change in a concise manner
0 the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge case may need to be considered at a later stage
0 did not find much info on the design
1 proposed change need more explanation at the file and system specifically what file need to be changed and how
0 the doc seems complete all aspect of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included a usecase diagram will be useful to add
0 e the design is very simple and explains the change required in a very clear manner
1 design approach are clearly explained yes the nd approach is the correct approach any design pattern used
1 the functionality scope is restricted because of the topic but the design doc cover everything what all is required to be done in the project
0 no
0 author have clearly explained the change to be made to the system the design document wa easy to understand
0 the design doc is sound and i believe no design pattern are required for this project
0 the author have adequately explained the change to be made to the design document
1 did not find much info on the design
0 design is simple and easy to understand
0 yes the design is quite simple
0 all the functionality is given for reviewmappingcontrollerrb along with the design pattern
1 the design look solid but it hard to tell without sufficient detail if anything causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that us the current language to return the correct string is more dry and maintainable than what we have now i wonder if dynamic translation gem are out there or would work the claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended eg it would take too much time
0 mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required change
1 the design doe not include any kind of diagram it would have been better if a flowchart or a class diagram could have been included in the document
1 the team ha done a good job trying to show with picture what their change will look like in the front end no uml ha been provided
1 it doe list out all the functionality but there seem to be no solution for them only a basic layout is present an insight into the solution to be implemented would be suggested
1 design appears to be sound however it is unclear where the nlp algorithm is supposed to go a in will the st iteration use another service to analyze with the button and then a nd iteration will add the local nlp algorithm
0 test plan for both of their subtasks were present
0 yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
0 the test case cover all of the functionality that they are going to implement
1 did not find much info on the design
0 yes uml diagram is provided and it is detailed flow diagram explains how suggestion will be given
0 yes their design appears to be sound
1 the design includes all the functionality required in the documentation httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentdbrhmswivlibwsfrvjmiytqljlslwhviucqqedit the main goal to let the ta be able to review any team that ha submitted the assignment is well stated i think some screenshots or other picture will be more helpful while explaining the functionality
0 easy to comprehend
0 the author have considerably improved on the document uml diagram a requested have been added
1 the uml diagram doe seems to be a bit at a high level i couldnt get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented
1 the design incorporates the basic functionality required that include refactoring the reviewmappingcontroller file to extrapolate it feature to the reportscontroller file it must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the report from responsereport method to the controller file
0 a the project is based upon making change to the ui of the system thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionality that they need to implement
0 since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive
1 no uml diagram
0 yes the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand they have also backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning
0 the explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project all the step piece up the project completely no suggestion
0 i liked the overall quality of the expalnation
1 similar to my earlier comment i found this document lacking on detail i also dont think their explanation for deriving the score to be sufficient their explanation is expressed a code not a a mathematical equation
1 the document is well written just that a uml diagram or something similar could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand
0 the design is good however there is no scope of using bad principle since the number of file that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just
0 have used visualization diagram appropriately
0 a far a the issue are concerned the solution do seem logical
1 the document clearly state what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature however i would suggest them to include how will they implement it there is no explanation of how thing will be done
0 well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission
0 yes the design is very simple lucid and efficient
0 yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
0 they have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue the diagram in turn help a lot to understand the flow of the system
0 the author have dived into the depth when explaining the change all of the change are well defined and precise
1 need some diagram or prototype
0 the test plan is compatible with the problem statement
0 the author have adequately explained the change to be made to the design document
0 the design document contain all required part
0 yes the current design look simple and wholesome seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rail internationalization work good job
0 change are explained well suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it probably some code snippet would help explaining that
1 the writeup is very minimal i think it should elaborate made
0 it is sound
0 simple and clear easy to understand
1 no uml diagram present suggestion although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like the team could have mentioned a use case diagram or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality
0 it ha most of the functional feature available
0 the project design doc is complete and specifies both issue and prospective solution
0 the flow and uml diagram are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow addition of detailed use case help support the diagram
1 so far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right directionhowever not much research is done so far i would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technology they plan to use work
0 use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow
1 the current explanation talk only about change in the view it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth
0 the design look good all the issue are stated and addressed nicely
0 yes the author ha provided a sufficient explanation of what change need to be done to the system by giving flow diagram and screenshots about what change they are going to incorporate in their system
1 the mockups do explain where the team intends to add the analyze button it however make no explanation of where the analysis will be shown
1 please add more detail about the solution
0 the design sound very reasonable
1 the design doc is well written but they havent specified any test plan theyve explained the step well but havent written anything about test
0 the design doe include test plan and plan to test the functionality
1 the diagram are missing in the document although much of it is explained in the screenshots a possible diagram would make the document stronger
1 solution have been proposed how they are going to do that is not mentioned
0 the design document is really well written it clearly describes what need to be done how it need to be done and what code change need to be made the file and table affected are clearly listed
1 the design encompasses all the feature in the specification it only indicates supporting one more language though whereas the design document specifies any language it seems out of the scope of the project but what if you used the google cloud translation api to translate the static string at run time then you could support almost any language there might be licensing issue though
1 there are no uml diagram a such in the writeuphowever there is a flowchart which somewhat give a clear view how they plan to do the thing
1 no design found on the wiki not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the change can be helpful
0 the design doe incorporate the functionality required of making review public allowing the student to toggle the visibility of review submitted it is descriptive and easy to understand
0 no test case
1 they only present a flow chart it will be better if there is a uml diagram
0 the flowchart included in the design document clearly explain the change that need to be done
1 the use of jquery plugin sound simple and easy to use
0 great use of mock ups really appreciate it
0 system is well defined
1 they have mentioned that they will be using rspec framework but have not given what test they will be implementing and hence can not comment if test will be shallow or not
0 the document is complete and well structured they have also incorporated the prototype comment and mentor feedback
1 the problem are described very nicely when it come to change to be made file to be modified are given i feel more explanation need to be given with respect to change in these file for each problem stating why this file need to be changed and what the impact will be
0 yes it is thoroughly investigated
0 they not only use use case diagram but also mockup screenshot to help the reader understand their design
0 the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principle
0 it fine i have the gist of it but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the project description the uml is a nice touch albeit super bare
0 uml diagram explains the change
0 the document is almost complete includes proper planning and demonstration only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done
1 there were no such solution listed on the basis of which i could suggest some better solution a couple of test case or issue resolution would have been handful for further suggestion
0 the author have added uml diagram a requested in the previous review and it ha made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
1 the writeup doe not talk about the functionality however they include what is missing and what they will include
0 yes simple straightforward solution
1 given uml diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change
1 change could be explained in detail i think that is missing a bit
0 have clearly mentioned when will github api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used
1 the screenshots for the view are great they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution however the design document lack use case or class diagram on how extenral entity interacts with the system and get response since the author are using external apis it would have been good if they could give more detail request and response
0 make include more detail for test plan other than that the wiki look very good
0 yes the design seems to incorporate appropriate design pattern the new view file added is also in accordance with design principle
1 the test case seem appropriate given that the only thing which need to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not
0 yes the author have adequately described the change required to be made to the system the process ha been divided into step and each step describes change in the mvc file good job
0 yes their doc ha adequately explained the change
0 yes the design is quite well understood and properly explained in a detailed manner through the flow diagram
0 yes the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principle that i know i loved the format of the documentation a well
0 they have covered mostly all the problem mentioned and given a tentative solution
0 the author have lucidly explained the change that are to be made to the system they show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to analyze the review content in the segmented text box the author have specified file that they plan to modify namely the view file responsehtmlerb and a partial selfreviewhtmlerb the team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metric that capture sentiment score sentiment tone whether suggestion are present or not chance of suggestion volume of text and the volume of text without stop word they also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the apione suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation they do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed nlp project for suggestion algorithm where user can test the suggestion metric
1 the document clearly specifies the problem statement it seems good enough they have mentioned the api they are planning to use a well a the file to be modified however i would like more detail on this api and how they plan to integrate it into their project
0 i am able to understand the purpose of the project
0 the team ha done tremendous job in the test plan they have already implemented the test case and given the path to run it
1 this logic to calculate composite score composite score max score self review score peer review score is basically taking the min score not sure what you are trying to achieve here it is not a good measure to calculate composite score
1 keeping the suggestion detection algorithm a a black box a stated in the design document i will comment on the input and output to the algorithm the input will be a text block of the review comment to the algorithm and the output is consisting of different field such a sentiment score sentiment analysis a positivenegative suggestion a present or absent however it is unclear to me a to what basis the suggestion detection algorithm detailsexplanationhigh level overview do you classify the data into suggestion classifier
0 yes the design is quite well understood and properly explained in a detailed manner through the flow diagram
0 the explanation is good and help get the point across
1 the design document clearly specifies all the issue that are going to be addressed by this project ui view are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirement moreover the author list the file that are going to be modified and the author comprehensively describe how the jquery tablesorter library will be used for three type of sorting one minor improvement would be to highlight the part associated with introduced change that link html table with the library for better readability
0 all the functionality is given for reviewmappingcontrollerrb along with the design pattern
0 yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagram illustrate the flow of control very well
1 there are some test plan in place and others will be done after the bug are generated suggestion it would have been great to have screenshots of the test plan
0 the design appears to be simple given the task at hand
0 i think more test can be added
0 no such thing like uml
1 the author havent given the file to be modified or the change they are going to do to the system
1 just one er diagram add use case and activityflow diagram
1 the design ha been listed with a few test plan i feel that there could be more test included suggestion test plan need to be explained more and could provide the code if tdd approach is used
0 explains the different approach with the help of use case diagram
1 the author hasnt mentioned any prospective change so this couldnt be looked in to
0 the author ha excellently explained about the change that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the change that they have incorporated also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer so overall a good explanation
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality
1 the author ha not suggested any change a of now
1 the autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggynot sure if it is in the scope of this project so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of interval like min
1 the author mention gem that they could potentially use but they do not mention where theyd be adding the associated code
0 the program flow diagram and an explanation a to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectation
1 uml diagram are not included
1 the author have adequately explained the change made to the system ot would have been better if some visual mode are added
0 yes i am surprised that they have already finished the project
0 the project is complete and sound enough in it approach and the implementation and the test plan ha been well devised and just shy of application
0 the design seems to be precise the description of the change are provided in detailthe team also ha mentioned about the api that they will use they have clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use enough effort have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it
0 adding a language column to the course table make sense and so doe leveraging thirdparty apis to handle the translation
1 lower level design change are missing author have only talked about config change no mention if the db requires any change
1 test are well covered however i dont see how the nicely constructed use case diagram is appropriate to be placed in the test plan section
0 no
1 the team ha discussed their plan using flowchart but they have not used any class diagram
0 the design is simple and easy to understand the sin wave and the description about it help to properly understand the change made and it impact
0 all necessary section are present
0 the design seems to be following dry principle
0 yes the design is simple and easy to understand
0 yes the design appears to be a simple a possible the team ha mentioned what need to be done and how they plan to implement it
1 a for the design proposed by the author it prof to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of design aspect in their doc sure they have defined an application flow but that is all there is to it nothing about adding a method to any class ha been suggested only a simple formula for composite score ha been written the design hasnt been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any preexisting gem for simplification this too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough detail to answer it with certainty yes absolutely a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause
0 the diagram provided clearly explain the flow control of the proposed solution the team even mention precondition needed for the flow control the only suggestion i have is that the team could also add a lowfi sketch or screenshot of how the view would like after beforeafter issue is fixed
1 the design document mention nothing about evaluation of how long the api take to return with a json
1 the author hasnt mentioned any prospective change so this couldnt be looked in to
0 the author have clearly mentioned the change to be made using problem statement and use case diagram
1 they used ui mockups to explain their implementation though some uml diagram like use case would be preferred over this
1 the design document coherently describes the project detail including it purpose and design this help to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goal however it could be improved by providing the test case that have been carried out to get to the present state
0 no implementation detail given so can not say how they
0 please add more information on the nlp algorithm team is trying to use
0 yes the design appears to be sound and us appropriate design principle
0 the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualization
0 good explanation for all solution
1 the mockups do explain where the team intends to add the analyze button it however make no explanation of where the analysis will be shown
1 created a great visual aid which help u explain the plan
0 yes they include the test plan
0 they have explained in detail about the proposed change with individual diagram for each case it is very thorough in explanation
1 the document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirement which are suggested by the change request however the team may change tone of the document a it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself the team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza link of existing and ongoing change and would be more reachable to a wider audience
0 the uml diagram is great which is clear and easy to understand
0 the screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output it would be nice to have a design diagram
0 great flowchart it help to see all the possible scenario in a compact manner
0 design document ha outlined the project requirement and issue they have proposed a solution to each problem they have even figured the file and method to be modified overall it look good
0 the design is really crisp and easy to understand one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured a well
0 the author have clearly explained the change to be made to the system they also have given the file to be modifiedadded for each change
0 yes one of the best design doc of project
0 the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principle the document is also well described
1 implementation detail are missing but the testing plan is ready
0 flow diagram explains the flow correctly
0 change suggested look good
1 content is good and well written from the last review i wa expecting little more in depth deatails on the implementation side i see no edits after nov except for the new image
0 a lot of visuals very helpful when viewer walk through the design
1 the problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart however some screenshot of the screen where change need to be made a well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful test plan is not stated in detail it just mention bullet point in test driven development adequately defining the test case is a important a developing a solution a per the problem statement this should be corrected
0 yes it cover all the functionality
0 the team ha added their mock ui which show they have thought about the change and modification mock uis of the screen show they are halfway the project
0 the design appears to be neat
0 yes the diagram clearly illustrate the proposed flow different diagram are provided for different issue one of the best wikis i have seen
0 the design document is good and i dont think any design pattern need to be followed a very few change are being made
0 the document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly
1 the team ha very well explained the step they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality they have stated every change they would be making for the change request in detail they have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement however the team ha not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation
0 the author adequately explained the change they plan to make
1 the design seems to be good it is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the file that they plan to add and the method in said file however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we havent advanced to the implementation stage yet the author seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem i think they should go ahead and use the gem
0 adequate explanation is provided they also mention what test are feasible to be performed
0 the author have explained all the change to be made very clearly and concisely each change is supplemented with sufficient diagram and mockups so a to make the final task of visualization easier
0 yes the design document contains all part of the functionality ensuring that nothing is missed out
0 the document outline all the required functionality along with the design and implementation plan stated
1 have covered almost all the issue it would have been better if an implementation plan wa provided
1 keeping the suggestion detection algorithm a a black box a stated in the design document i will comment on the input and output to the algorithm the input will be a text block of the review comment to the algorithm and the output is consisting of different field such a sentiment score sentiment analysis a positivenegative suggestion a present or absent however it is unclear to me a to what basis the suggestion detection algorithm detailsexplanationhigh level overview do you classify the data into suggestion classifier
1 the team ha well documented the problem statement and the detail of the fix which is required however they have not included any design plan or test plan which could address the approach they have planned
1 yes the design includes a test plan it s adequate to test all functionality of the newly introduced controller it doesnt talk in detail about the way the system is to be tested and what is the exact outcome to be verified
0 the design look good the code is already committed and approved by the concerned team good job
1 yes they have improved the uml diagram from last round and it it a standard class uml diagram it very selfexplanatory though the diagram under test plan should be clearer also there could have been a sample report generated for reference
0 yes i believe they have included all of the required functionality
1 the wiki page is prepared with a good research on the topic just test plan are left to be added
0 well after reading all the proposed solution i think they look good and the explanation behind all of them are satisfactory a well
1 yes they included some design principle which is good maybe the author could add some design pattern into wiki
0 yes all the issue mentioned in the project description are covered along with their proposed solution good job
0 the test plan ha all the manual testing and automatic testing to be done on each issue
0 overall team ha done good work on visualization hope to see the actual image of expertiza by the end of the project
0 their design is simple and clear
0 the document includes flowchart which clearly describe the project flow and what need to be done
0 yes it doe
0 the proposed search feature are good if all of them are implemented it should more than suffice
0 yes they have
0 yes the required functionality is adequately explained good work in that
0 the team ha done tremendous job in adding visualization aid they have added application flow diagram and visualized image they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self review and score page this make the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand
0 the design document is very thorough indicating whats the problem how system work and proposed soluion
0 yes
1 the placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema they have also not included the test case
0 yes it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issue it is very clearly explained one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured a well
1 visualization offer only a flow chart but other uml diagram like class diagram would have been more helpful
1 more effort should be expended on the designthe current explanation talk only about change in the view it would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth
0 the design seems to be flawless all the principle and pattern used are flawless and to the point
0 the design document is very thorough indicating whats the problem how system work and proposed soluion
1 diagram are used from previous project no diagram explaining newer functionality
0 the design document is good and i dont think any design pattern need to be followed a very few change are being made
0 yes only view file are involving since this topic is about changing the language
0 the design document contain all required part
1 no diagram
1 the design is ambiguous the team only said they will make some change to the current system but didnt state clearly what kind of change they will make and how these change will be done for example for the first step we need more information about how the team will change the ui the model and the controller or helper to realize what the team said
0 there are some test plan in place and others will be done after the bug are generated suggestion it would have been great to have screenshots of the test plan
0 i think that the author have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the change to be made overall this is the best document i have seen so far
1 i think more test can be added
1 the test given test there change which is enough
0 the design look good enough it mostly deal with htmlerb file to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllersi do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system suggestion if the detail regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given i did not find any detail regarding about any method that will be used to implement the functionality that too would have been useful
0 the doc mention the change to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding
0 yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the change to the review section
0 the author have incorporated all the functionality required
1 test plan need to be expanded to describe each unitfunctional test team plan to write for each of the report
0 yes
1 only the issuesproblem statement is included in the documentation a of now the tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submission
0 the team ha explained the solution with flow chart and code snippet they have even considered the feasibility of their solution which is a good thing a this is a big project so feasibility is a big factor
1 the design doc is well written but they havent specified any test plan theyve explained the step well but havent written anything about test
0 the design appears to be sound also follows proper design principle eg for making change to nomination and review question inheritance is used inheriting method from question parent class
0 yes design appears to be very simple
0 the explanation is very detailed and easy to understand
0 the document adequately describes the project description and proposal made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the category selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
0 the author have explained the change in depth and with proper detail
1 the design doe include enough test plan the team ha provided the code screenshots for the same suggestion could have put link to the git code so that the wiki could have been short and precise
1 diagram included in the implementation plan is confusing a better way would have been to include a diagram to indicate the step by step flow
1 there is a hint of visual aid in term of the section of application flow for the instructor and student and thus we can say that it doe slightly help get a sense of putting thing into perspective none both the diagram seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionality the uml diagram is in line with the convention and follows suite the diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail
0 nice wiki page
0 they showed all the detail which were asked for
0 the design document look really good all section are properly described screenshots included a possible uml or workflow diagram would have been appreciated
1 the author have improved the part of the document that describes the interaction between html and javascript part since the st round while this assignment doe not require an extensive discussion about the design principle or pattern it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic
1 only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution please add design and uml diagram
1 the author have shown screenshots of example output a a part of visualization this show the original page the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to hindi though this visualization display the final output there is no visualization that show the design and implementation of this new feature
1 the team ha not mentioned about how they are planning to do the change
0 explained detail about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation
0 the designproposed solution look completely logical and should fix the bug with noleast redundancy it also look like the team ha already managed to fix a few bug a well kudos to them
0 they have used apt visual aid like uml diagram and screen shot
0 the project documentation look complete with clear detail about the purpose to enable the student to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metric like volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric they have delineated the design that includes the file that the team proposes to change the view appviewsresponseresponsehtmlerb and the partial appviewssubmittedcontentselfreviewhtmlerb the screenshot of the existing ui of the review section and how the ui would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metric will emerge when the button is clicked i specifically like how the test plan includes their feature in the connextra format they have mentioned scenario one where the student click the button without entering text in which case the popup alert the reviewer saying no text f
1 the design includes test planmanual testing is emphasized more than automation testing moreover how automation testing will be done ha not been described
1 yes their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project but how the team will achieve the few not so straightforward sorting such a the one indicated in author feedback report is not clear to conclude their approach will achieve the intended functionality
1 they have test plan but i dont think they include test in it they just put some example about how to run their code
1 the design document is comprehensive and cover most of the relevant topic general problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project the solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several type of sorting that need to be done this is followed by the file that will be modified in the scope of this project the primary problem is that the document doe not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decision and implementation strategy it is stated that script have been added at the top of the file to sort the content of table i would suggest elaborating on the specific what function are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table content
0 team have decided to give all detail after final submission a design doc should be available before starting the project i would recommend to provide few detail on project design class involved in the project or application flow etc
0 yes simple straightforward solution
1 no visuals are u
0 yes simple straightforward solution
0 yes design appears to be sound
0 their solution sound good
0 the entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirement the document aligns with the plan of action and showcase the exact purpose of the project
0 the design look clear and complete and is using a strategy pattern for implementation
0 not show which method
0 yes the author have specified the change to be made in the system under the proposed project design the change have been included a sub heading with sub point under each the author have also included a relevant file heading that includes the file where change are madethe change involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course in the process a separate language column will be added to the course table and a dropdown of language in the edit course page where a language can be chosen once the instructor update the edit course page with the chosen language the static string in the expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language for adding multilanguage support google translate and rail internationalization api is being used also two yaml file enyml and hienyml contains the translated string for the respective language the routesrb file and all the view file will be correspondingly modified to show the different language after reading from the y
0 yes the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also give the possible solution
1 the author ha made a test plan but it is reactive instead of proactive the test plan for the change to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario
1 the change proposed by the author are elaborate overall they have defined the change extensively however the search for review section could have elaborated more about the search functionality the author could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately
0 author solution do not seem to create method to wrong class new design code doe not make the code smelly no new gem required explained solution is adequate proposed design should not hamper system performance well effort expended on the design
0 the test plan are excellent the best i have seen so farit ha accurately taken all test case into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
0 the design document give detail about the problem statement and give an idea about what is to be done in the project it specifies what file will be modified and the test plan also contains scenario mentioned no suggestion
0 the team ha explained the solution with flow chart and code snippet they have even considered the feasibility of their solution which is a good thing a this is a big project so feasibility is a big factor
0 team ha added all the diagram and screenshots the document is well explained and look complete
1 the document doe not include any test plan
1 did not see much info on the file or class the change proposed so it hard to comment here
0 great documentation tbh the best i have seen yet
0 yes the design try to cover all the requested feature
0 yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand
1 a through testplan is described i do think test case could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand overall look good
1 the document mention the tool of jquery sorting table in fact which api or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document also this project seems to focus on the view part of expertiza so the test plan should be more detailed cover more edge case
0 good design
0 all proposed change seem to be in line with good coding practice and the expertiza system guideline
0 the team ha adequately explained all of the change required for segregation including the exact report and function to be removed out of reviewmappingcontrollerrb along with the design pattern to be followedstrategy in this case
0 i dont see any trace of smell or redundancy in the proposed solution
1 there were mockups of the final result of the project however there were no uml diagram i think the uml diagram are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document maybe they could have done a mockup of how some of the other view would have looked like once the language ha changed especially the page with flash message if any currently they have just shown the proposed change on the page where the instructor will change the language
0 the screenshots of the expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution
1 the team ha very well explained the step they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality they have stated every change they would be making for the change request in detail they have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement however the team ha not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation
0 the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it visualization is among the best ive reviewed till date the author ha put in a lot of effort for the same the diagram make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
0 the design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code change
0 the use case diagram properly show how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role
0 no visulization is necessary for this project
1 the design is appreciable there could be some more explanation and implementation detail to it
0 yes the author have specified the change to be made in the system under the proposed project design the change have been included a sub heading with sub point under each the author have also included a relevant file heading that includes the file where change are madethe change involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course in the process a separate language column will be added to the course table and a dropdown of language in the edit course page where a language can be chosen once the instructor update the edit course page with the chosen language the static string in the expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language for adding multilanguage support google translate and rail internationalization api is being used also two yaml file enyml and hienyml contains the translated string for the respective language the routesrb file and all the view file will be correspondingly modified to show the different language after reading from the y
0 though i couldnt follow everything overall the design seems to do the right thing
0 yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
1 the team ha ha listed the file that they propose to change namely the view appviewsresponseresponsehtmlerb and the partial appviewssubmittedcontentselfreviewhtmlerb however they could have described what these file currently do and their purpose in the documentation the author have embedded screenshots of how the ui of the review page will look after the analyze button will be included they have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metric pertaining to a review namely volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metric will be generated once the button is clicked
0 yes i believe they have included all of the required functionality
0 i like the use case diagram but i would like class diagram or a database visualization too so it easier to understand how the crosscourse assignment linking will work
0 code level detail are not covered in this doc but the highlevel approach look fine to me
0 yes it includes the test plan with a great detail
1 this seems complete to me they have the introduction with a purpose and problem a ui mockup and use case it doe seem odd that the use case are listed in the test plan
0 screenshot explains the functionality of project very wellit is really easier to understand how the end product will look like suggestion the team should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality
1 the test section look inadequate a of now only two test scenario are mentioned and no detail on automation or ui more so no mention of test in the document
1 i suggest the testing plan be improved in place of giving step on how a reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write test for the functionality added the rspec could be something like expectpageto havecontentsorted
0 the change are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make change only suggestion would be to include more about how these change are going to be done
0 yes they include the test plan
1 the overall design look good the score calculation formula still look a bit weird using the current formula it is possible to have a higher composite score than each of the individual score which should not be the case
0 they explained their plan very well both the visual aid and the word they use are very clear
0 the author seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project they also seem to follow dry principle while adding and changing code also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code
1 not so good structure
1 they have mentioned the method to calculate the composite review but where this method is planned to be added in expertiza is unclear this need to be mentioned
0 there is an er diagram which defines the relationship in the system
1 the complexity is again a big unknown to me a they have kept the algorithm a a black box it is unclear where the algorithm change are to be implemented if it is in a controller and if yes in which controller i suggest the author to provide internal detail of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better a of now i am clear about their input and output format however i would like to know which function do they interface with
0 the design document incorporated all the functionality that the project is supposed to be implementing no suggestion
1 the introduction paragraph contains bullet that are identical to e which is surprising the flowchart doe not cover no or negative case and is thus incomplete what is logged in the db and how exactly is start and end time is very ambiguous apart from a mention of merging the data of the detail page on the current report page in the introduction i can not see any further discussion of this particular objective for autosave you could think of using the onunload event of javascript like onload event also settimeout doesnt seem to be an efficient idea since that would make too many number of call from the page i guess you would be sending an ajax request which is asynchronous a next call might be made before a previous call response is handled when you say for each time the reviewer start a review it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database if it doe exist then it will update the
1 no detail of the proposed design
1 the author have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using they have mentioned the file that need to be modified
0 the team explained them design very well it is easy to follow their idea
0 the bar chart have been added to the design report the visualization have been added to view also and the screen shot have been added too the only thing that i would like to add is that the bar chart could have been more descriptive a in they could have added detail for x label and y label and also put legend this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying
0 yes the author do have an adequate explanation
1 the design document look very crisp and clear the work flow proposed solution and test plan are all listed good work a screenshot or two of the test case would have made it even better
0 the design is both simple and clear it should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review both a a final examination and a testing
0 author have clearly explained all the change to be made and where to make them the design document is quite clear and easy to understand
0 the explanation are adequate and easy to follow
0 yes the document seems to be perfect it doe follow all the appropriate principle and pattern no suggestion required
0 yes it doe
1 screenshots are added which are enough to tell what they will be doing in the front end a bit more can be explained on backend part by giving code snippet
0 yes design doe include a welldescribed test plan the provided test will surely test the functionality which will be implemenedt the test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including presteps and different testing expectation great work no suggestion are required
1 the uml use case diagram take into consideration the system specification and the manner in which the user interact with each other in the process it make it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario
0 looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion and low coupling it good that all the change are restricted to the routesrb and configlocales file so that the resulting change wont be messy and ruin the rest of the system also this help in refactoring if needed in the future a there will be limited number of file to be changed
0 they team ha done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagram they have created uml diagram which depicts the flow of the admin and student along with other actor a mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which make it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirement in the expertiza system
0 the team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the score and indicate the performance of student
0 i dont think the author plan to add method to a wrong class they seem to be working on the right class namely review and it associated view page reviewhtmlerb that exactly pertains to their project the response time might potentially increase with this new feature but fortunately the team ha proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it doe not take forever to execute the team ha done a good job on the design documentation
0 good explanation easy to follow
1 it would be better to add more diagram
1 no test plan is included they can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope
1 seems like all part of the design document need more detail
0 the document adequately describes the project description and proposal made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the category selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
0 could have included some screenshots otherwise great work by the team on uml diagram
0 the document wa very well written previously too and they have improved it with diagram and test nice work
