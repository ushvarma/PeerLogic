The design document is well done with proper visual aids and explains the problem being tackled and the proposed solution very well.,0
The design doc looks complete with all of the necessary details being covered.,0
  They showed all the details which were asked for,0
"Brilliantly written code document consisting of background, problem statement and the implementation plan. ",0
The authors have dine a good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. UML diagrams like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.,0
"The design incorporates  all the functionalities that needs to be implemented. No suggestions are required.  

 ",0
The suggested fix would address all the functionalities which is required to be implemented for the problem statement.,0
"  Yes the design include all the required functionalities as their design plan. the problem statement specifies 3 task one is related to the admin panel , and two are related to the instructor panel . in their plan they have specified their approach and which all files need modification",0
"The document outlines all the required functionalities along with the design and implementation plan stated  

 ",0
All the requirements have been covered,0
"Yes, most of the functionality are included. Besides, they also got detailed explanations.",0
Yes. It incorporates all the functionality required by this project.,0
Yes the design doc covers all of the required functionalities.,0
It seems that the design incorporates all of the necessary functionality. It also mentions details of how the team is going to implement said functionality.,0
  Some more specific details could be added,0
"Yes, functionalities mentioned are covered in the doc",0
"Yes, it covers everything.",0
Yes.,0
"Yes, the authors have a great job of including all the needed functionality. ",0
"The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.  

Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.",0
The team has proposed reasonable changes to address the problem statement in detail. The explanation justifies every change they have suggested.,0
  The changes that the author has proposed is quite inclined with the task that are expected to be completed. the author explains the the changes properly by mentioning the files that needs to updated along with the screenshots of the flow.,0
"The explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like UML diagrams, explanation of the use cases etc. ",0
Looks like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution. Good Job,0
Their explanation is adequate and easy to understand.,0
"The authors have given adequate explanation in terms of the following what is existing currently, what needs to be changed. The have also explained with a diagram the exact place where they would be adding elements to the UI. Also the files required to be changed are also mentioned. ",0
  The suggested changes seem to be appropriate. Explanation was also easy to follow.,0
The overall quality of explanations is very detailed and good. I might even take few ideas from here to improve my own design doc.,0
  They have explained adequately,0
"Yes very well done in explanation of changes and what needs to be done.

Screen shots are helpful. good work ",0
Comprehensive.,0
"Detailed implementation plan provided, including which files they expect to change and what the output should look like",0
The authors have done a pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. They have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. Adding a flow chart would make things much clearer.,0
The design  seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail. Team has clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use.  Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. ,0
"  As the project is more of adding features to the user interface of the website , the design plan is covering all the necessary steps that needs to be implemented",0
"The code design appears to be sound. The UI implementation as shown on the screenshot  looks intuitive. However, the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly ",0
"Design is good, there might be some changes when they start implementing it but its a good starting point.",0
The design appear to be good. Specific gems are also mentioned eg: paginate that would divide the document into discrete pages.,0
The design changes as described seem sound.,0
I don't see any trace of smells or redundancy in the proposed solution.,0
"The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used.",0
No potential smells or problems found.,0
"Screenshot explains the functionality of project very well.It is really easier to understand how the end product will look like.

Suggestion:  the team  should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. ",0
They have added a screenshot for each of the problem they plan to tackle.,0
"They show their design page as their visual aids, and their are helpful for readers to understand what their designs look like.",0
"UML diagrams are not mentioned but since these are UI changes, the changes are sufficiently explained with the help of representation of UI in terms of images.",0
"The whole document is easy to understand and well-written.

Suggestion: It would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.",0
There were ample of visual aids to explain and walk through the proposed solution. I liked it.,0
"Good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach.

Include Use case and activity/flow diagrams also.",0
UI enhancements are provided here.,0
"They authors have used visual aids to their benefit. Even though they could have added a flow diagram, the wire frames and other screenshots they have used serve the purpose and add to the clarity of the explanation.",0
  This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work,0
"  Its fine. I have the gist of it, but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the Project Description.

The uml is a nice touch, albeit super bare.",0
Well structured i think everything is covered,0
The document explains well how the team is planning to approach the refactoring.,0
The team has incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of  review_mapping_controller.rb  along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy in this case).,0
"  In a way, yes, because it copied the project description, and illuminated which models they wanted to create in the refactor.",0
  The design document includes all the functionality the team is hoping to achieve. they have explained clearly what they plan to work and modify.,0
It has most of the functional features available.,0
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.",0
All the functionality is given for review_mapping_controller.rb  along with the design pattern. ,0
The explanation is easy to follow. I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.,0
Expectations look attainable. The changes proposed are concise and crisp. Team should be able to do a good job with this implementation.,0
"  Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.",0
The explanation is decent and comprehensible ,0
I don't see any of the above mentioned problems happening since the design matches perfectly with the objective. The topic itself is to move unnecessary  code out of review_mapping_controller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner  and better.,0
"The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.",0
The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.   ,0
No problem  I could observe ,0
"The UML class diagram helps to understand the reports involved, their attributes and functionalities. It provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different reports.",0
"The authors provide a UML diagram to explain the relationship between the classes and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button, which are really helpful.",0
  This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work,0
Well structured i think everything is covered,0

  Not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question.,0
The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.   ,0
The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.,0
No problem  I could observe ,0
"The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.",0
The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.,0
The UML diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods,0
"The UML class diagram helps to understand the reports involved, their attributes and functionalities. It provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different reports.",0
"The authors provide a UML diagram to explain the relationship between the classes and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button, which are really helpful.",0
A brief  description for the class level implementation would be better.,0
"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.",0
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",0
"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which  show thoroughness of their approach ",0
"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki.

The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do.

The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding.

The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing.

Suggestion:  

The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc...

the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.",0
"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.",0
"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.",0
All necessary sections are present.,0
Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities,0
Incorporates intended functionality.,0
"Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.",0
The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.,0
Yes,0
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance.

suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",0
The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.,0
The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.,0
"The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  

No suggestions. ",0
Yes,0
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",0
Changes suggested look good.,0
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",0
the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.,0
"The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective.

no particular suggestions proposed",0
The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.,0
"The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the  results  with a minimal look.   

  

 ",0
"A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  

No suggestions.",0
For Now the design proposed looks perfect.,0
Design flow looks good.,0
The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.,0
"The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code ""smelly""",0
The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.,0
"The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system.

Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. ",0
"The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow",0
Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.,0
"The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.",0
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations.

"The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose.

Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.",0
The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza  view.,0
The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.,0
"A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  

Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. ",0
Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the  process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.,0
The design doc is well designed and complete.,0
They give the graph of the UI design which is good and explicit.,0
Clear understanding  of what needs to be done,0
changes along with the screen mockup are provided   ,0

They seem to have a clear idea of what they are going to do,0
The design docs looks complete with all of the details being covered.,0
Yes design doc cover all of the functionaliites.,0
I liked the overall quality of the expalnation.,0
All the proposed changes look like exactly what needs to be implemented in this project.,0
Please add more details about the solution.,0
It includes all the sections,0
I don't think they need any visual aids.,0

The document is almost complete. Includes proper planning and demonstration. Only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done. ,0
"The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. The doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed.  

Suggestion: I feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate. The team did mention one scenario. I feel like there could have been many more. But, as all the required things are present, I am giving this post full stars. ",0
"Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. ",0
"The design  encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the  Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings  at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.",0
"Yes, The design document contains all parts of the functionality, ensuring that nothing is missed out.",0

No suggestions.",0
The design seemed good.,0
"The design looks solid, but it's hard to tell without sufficient detail. If anything, causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more DRY and maintainable than what we have now. I wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work. The claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended, e.g. it would take too much time.",0
"Looking at the doc, it seems like the design is precise. The description of the changes are provided in details ensuring the satisfaction of the reader.",0
"The design proposed is the natural way anyone would go around solving those issues, for example creating separate yaml files for different languages and then picking up the strings from there. ",0
"Looks good, only view files are involving the changes.",0
well designed,0
The design seems sound. The team plans to add all translations of the static variables in a separate folder. I think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system. I would like to see this design in action before making a judgement.,0
"The document does not go much into the technical details. The limited details provided sounds right. However, more research will generate better understanding.",0

There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.,0
"Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.",0
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the  problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.,0
Design doc contains everything in clear explanation,0
It incorporates all the functionalites.,0

The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.,0
Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality,0
need some diagram or prototype. ,0
Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good ,0
"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.",0
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files.

The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"".

The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.",0
"The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code ""smelly""",0
The solution seems right.,0
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,0
The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.,0
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the  problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.,0
Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.,0
"The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like  volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view-  app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  

I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text f",0
"The design doc is clean and neat. It specifies the issues and prospective solutions, which are easy to follow.",0
Yes the documentation looks complete and states the project purpose and solution are stated . The project design could be described in more detail.,0

"Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.",0
"  Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons.",0
I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.,0
"Yes, the design document incorporates the  plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.",0
yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.,0

Yes. ,0
"The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  

No suggestions. ",0
"The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.",0
The explanation  is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.,0

The doc seems complete. All aspects of the  problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.,0
Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.,0
"The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like  volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view-  app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  

I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text f",0
"looks great. test plan , screenshots are all given.

uml is missing but i don't think its required as the changes are in html.",0
The design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objectives. The test plan indicates what aspects are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted.,0
The document is complete and very clear.,0
"The design document gives details about the problem statement and gives an idea about what is to be done in the project. It specifies what files will be modified and the test plan also contains 2 scenarios mentioned.

No suggestions.

 ",0
"Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.",0
"  Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons.",0
I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.,0
"Yes, the design document incorporates the  plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.",0
yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.,0
The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,0
"Yes, they have discussed about all the functionality",0
Yes. ,0
"The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  

No suggestions. ",0
I am able to understand the purpose of the project.,0
  Add a button to these questions to analyze them for their helpfulness. Seems clear to me.,0
Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.,0
"The explanation  is pretty good, I particularly found the images explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive.",0
changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.,0
"The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.",0
The explanation  is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.,0
"The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it.

Suggestion:

You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.

 ",0
The explanations are lucid.,0
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,0
The design seems to be following DRY principle. ,0
"The design appears to be sound, and wouldn't conflict with the existing classes or methods. ",0
"2 html files require change, i don't think it will affect anything.",0
"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however i feel the author is on track to make the right changes by looking at the files intended to be modified.",0
Not much has been talked about the methods to be added. but the files specified seems right,0
"I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system.

Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention    ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ",0
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,0
The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,0

"These changes seem to be appropriate  for the objectives they have. Only a small set of files are being changed, and the functionality is isolated well. My only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking.",0
The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.,0

The doc seems complete. All aspects of the  problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.,0
The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza  since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.,0
Design doc contains everything in clear explanation,0
"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. ",0
"There are no diagrams present.

It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.",0
"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.",0
"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. ",0
"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.",0
"1)       The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable",0
"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.",0
Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good ,0
"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.",0
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files.

The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"".

The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.",0
"The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code ""smelly""",0
The solution seems right.,0
"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  

Suggestion:

You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it.

Query:

Do you plan on creating a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.",0

"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields.

Suggestions:

Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.

  

 ",0
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.,0
I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.,0
Design document contains all the functionality required.,0
It incorporates all the functionalites.,0
It includes all the sections,0
"Except for the test plan, the design doc seems to have all the important details. The team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a test-driven development. ",0
"Test  plan is to be added, but the purpose and the design are coherent and easy to follow.",0
"The test plan is not yet done. Rest, I could see that the document is very much complete.",0
Yes the design looks complete,0
So far the idea is clearly articulated. Few things which are not  defined are explicitly stated in the doc.,0
"Yes, it does",0
"Includes everything, as far as I can tell.",0
Yes. The design document incorporates all the functionalities stated in problem statement. ,0
The design has not been stated explicitly so its difficult to comment only with the flow and UML diagrams whether it is appropriate and the best way to address the issue.,0
Authors have a clear idea of what details need to be included to make the audience understand the purpose of the project. The design document is sufficient to get the basic idea and implementation.,0
The design does incorporate the functionality required of making reviews public allowing the students to toggle the visibility of review submitted. It is descriptive and easy to understand.,0
It's not a great explanation,0
"Document is explained well.

Also the flow of document is good.

Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well.",0
The proposed flows and project tasks are sufficiently detailed that I can understand the relationship between the issue and how they're going to solve it in each step.,0

The team has not addressed the project design approach and the proposed implementation details in the documentation.,0
"1. Authors solution do not seem to create methods to wrong classes.

2. New design code does not make the code ""smelly"".

3. No new gem required. Explained solution is adequate.

4. Proposed design should not hamper system performance.

5. Well efforts expended on the design

 ",0
"I don't have any issues with the design, looking forward to seeing some code snippets to understand it better.",0
"As mentioned in their Approach section, the team decided on adding some functionalities like checkboxes and views. I find these changes perfect for the problem statement given.",0
Implementation details haven't been added yet but that's fine as it hasn't been started yet.,0
The design looks fine but no explanation as to why this is done? Is it already existing or is this a new feature?,0
"I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.

 ",0
The team has  done a commendable job in creating a very detailed  UML diagram and explaining the case of every user very well.,0
No UML diagrams,0
"Only a single UML diagram is present, but I'd have appreciated a couple of flow charts to accompany the expected  flows.",0
They have used a USE case diagram to explain flow. I found it quite understandable and all the steps are clearly drawn out in the diagram. It clearly explains the steps required to approach a situation.,0
"The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details.

However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.   ",0
"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified.

Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.",0
"They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.   ",0
"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting.

One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.",0

"Yes, the design seems to be sound.",0
The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by  listing its advantages.,0
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. ,0
"The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery.

As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.",0
"The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts  since the 1st round.

While this assignment does not require an extensive  discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better  if the document explicitly addressed this topic.",0
"Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.",0
"This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.",0
This their design is very simple and clear.,0
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained  by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well.

The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.",0
"Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.",0
"Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the jQuery tablesorter gem.",0
The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :),0
"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good,

But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly.

The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.",0

The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.,0
They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.,0
The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.,0
"The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.",0
They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.,0
Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.,0
Design seems correct.,0
"Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.",0
yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.,0
System is well defined ,0
The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. ,0
"The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.",0
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.",0
Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. ,0
Design is simple and easy to understand.,0

The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy,0
Using google charts is a good idea.,0
"From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.",0
"Yes, design involves google charts API  and seems very simple.",0
Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.,0
Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.,0
"Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.",0
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying. ,0
They have worked on their weak  point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.,0
"The sample data visualizations is good.

The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.",0
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",0
The team already has mockups for their design.,0
"The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.",0
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,0
Really good visualization provided.,0
"According to the team ""The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests""  but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using  the  RSpec  testing framework. Overall, the test plan sounds good ",0
No tests are required for the project as stated,0
This team did not require any tests.,0
The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement  is very minimal since most changes are in view.,0
"The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.",0
"Yes the design is sound and appeopriate. However, it may be better to implement more code level design.",0
Simple and clear. Easy to understand.,0
"It gives a high-level design picture and two scratches of UI, which are all good and understandable.",0
"The test plan is completed. Just one suggestion that it can be more specific. For example, it may include some real test cases.",0
"Yes, have included the flow of the process in the second round of interview",0
"1) The document clearly mentions the changes to be made to the existing system and requirements that need to be delivered.

2) Also mentions the changes to be made to the UI.

3) The files to be added/modified are also mentioned.",0
1) Follows appropriate design principles and patterns.,0
"1) Yes, the design appears to be simple.",0
"1) Document includes test plan.

2) However can include more test cases.",0
"yes, there is no mention of design pattern yet but overall design appear very clear to me",0
"mockup  diagrams really make it easy to understand

 ",0

I see that they added an additional flow diagram that is further helping in the understanding,0
They have mentioned about possible tests required for the project.,0
"Well, they have mentioned what needs to be done, what changes have to be implemented.",0
It does appear to be sound and in sync with the DRY principles.,0
"Well, the design does look simple. It is not difficult to understand the principle.",0
"UI mockups and UML diagrams are descriptive. However, more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem",0
"Yes, diagrams are self-explanatory.",0
The design appears to be sound following all the appropriate principles and patterns. I liked the overall flow of the document.,0
The design looks to be simple and clear to me. It clearly states what files are going to be changed and as per my knowledge there is no redundant and unnecessary change.,0
i liked the visualizations used this time around. they have certainly improved from the last time. I liked the overall used of high and low level visualisations provided.,0
Even though few test cases have been provided I feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps  involved in the testing.,0
"The issues have been identified and documented clearly.  However, a little more of explanation is required for the  solutions proposed for issues 2 - 5. They seem to me at a very high level.",0
"Yes, they look well written and easy to follow with all the visual aids.",0
Very well written document. Good job team.,0
I understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system.,0
Drastic improvements have been made to design doc. ,0
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.  

 ",0
"The design looks good.

All the issues are stated and addressed nicely.",0
"Yes, the deisgn appears to be totally sound. The changes proposed are very standardized, and follows appropriate industry standards.",0
the design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns.,0
Clearly explained with diagrams and UML diagrams.,0
"  

The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  

Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. ",0
"Since the project is aimed at fixing the issues, no design patterns need to be used.",0
"The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !

 ",0
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",0
"The design does not seem that complex.

The team has clearly mentioned the issues and the way to go about it.

 ",0
"Yes, the design is very simple, lucid and efficient.",0
"yes, only a few files are being modified.",0
The design is simple. ,0
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",0
The explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read.,0
"It was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don't exist, but that's not the team's fault.",0
"The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the changes that will be made to achieve the desired results.  

Great Work !",0
The design  document is  easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,0
Great use of mock ups and UML diagrams. It makes understanding the issues easier. Looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it. ,0
"The visualization is great.

All the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required.",0
"The visualization is by far the best part of this writeup. Also, it's visualization is among the best I've reviewed till date. The author has put in a lot of efforts for the same. The diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand.",0
"A lots of visuals, very helpful when viewers walk through the design.",0
Great work by the team on UML diagrams. ,0
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. They have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the Expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same. ",0
This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,0
"The team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand.  

Great work with the UI mockups / project design / UML diagrams.",0
"As per the requirement document, test cases are not required.",0
"Yes, they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand.",0
The aspect of re-producing the issues are very clearly mentioned and hence tests are written briefly which can be easily understood.,0
The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.,0
The authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes. All of the changes are well defined and precise.,0
"Yes, they did.",0
"The authors have very well explained the problem statement and the changes to be made to the system, including flowcharts, the files to be modified/added and useful links.",0
Authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. The design document was easy to understand.,0
"The team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the WebAudio API by implementing missing pieces of incomplete node types (OscillatorNode) along with entire missing nodes (ConstantSourceNode, StereoPannerNode, IIRFilterNode). ",0
"Yes, they made detailed explanation about their changes.",0
The design seems to be flawless. All the principles and patterns used are flawless and to the point.,0
"Yep, they have good structure to show what and how they gonna do with the project",0
The design looks good. The code is already committed and approved by the concerned team. Good Job !,0
"Yes, their design appears to be sound.",0
The design appears to be sound and following appropriate principles.,0
"yeah, Their  proposed design includes workflow, initial step, and subsequent steps. It was easy to follow their design. Their solution appears to be sound.",0
"I don't exactly understand how the waveforms help to produce the sound for the new browser they're adding support for, but other than that, their approach seems solid.",0
"Yes, I am  surprised that they have already finished the project. ",0
The design is concise and clear.,0
The design is simple and easy to understand. The sin waves and the description about it helps to properly understand the changes made and its impact.,0
The design was not unnecessarily complex. It was as easy as it could be.,0
Use of flowcharts and step by step explanation simplified  their solution. It was easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple.,0
Very simple and clear.,0
The team has done tremendous job in the test plan they have already implemented the test cases and given the path to run it.,0
The provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly.,0
They have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet.,0
the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities ,0
The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.,0
"Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.",0
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,0
Yes. ,0
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the y",0
The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.,0
The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.,0
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",0
Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.,0
"The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.",0
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",0
It is sound.,0
Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.,0
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",0
"Yes, simple straightforward solution.

 ",0
The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.,0
Simple and easy to understand steps.,0
Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language.,0
The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.,0
The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.,0
"Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job  

 ",0
The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.,0
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.",0
The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.,0
mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.,0
No visualization or diagrams are necessary.,0
"A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.",0
The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. ,0
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,0
Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.,0
"Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language.",0
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,0
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. ",0
  Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system,0
Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.,0
"Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.",0
"1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system.

2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.

 ",0
Authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them. The design document is quite clear and easy to understand.,0
I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.,0
The document seems complete,0
"Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!",0
"The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.",0
The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.,0
"Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns.

suggestions: not required.",0
"  As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .",0
Design is good,0
"Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.",0
"1) The design appears to be sound.

2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)",0
They have explained very well,0
"Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.  

 ",0
"Yes, looks clean.

Any design patterns used????",0
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. ",0
"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.",0
The design  seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.,0
"The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take.

Done a good job. No rework required.",0
"  Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.",0
"Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.",0
"1) The design is simple and well modularized.

2) Each method is implementing only one task as it should.",0
The design does appear to be as simple as possible. The team have not unnecessarily complicated the project.,0
"Yes, the design is pretty simple and to the point. The design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary.",0
  The design is straightforward and as simple as possible. The team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock-ups. This has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion.,0
"Yes, adequate amount of details present",0
"Yes!  

The requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points.",0
"yes, design appears to be very simple.",0
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",0
"Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is  easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.",0
They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,0
  Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,0
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,0
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",0
"The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand.",0
I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.,0
"Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  

Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ",0
"Yes, the  uml  diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",0
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,0
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,0
"They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios for the project in their test.

Their test plan is highly appreciative.",0
  The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.,0
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,0
"Yes, they include the test plan.",0
1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.,0
"Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.",0
The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great  quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.,0
The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!,0

The design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lots of methods of searching.,0
YEs based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple as possible.,0
"Yes, easy to understand.",0
The design has been explained in a simple way. The team has explained the design using use cases which is easy to comprehend.,0
"Yes, the design is simple and feasible.",0
"Yes, clear and simple.",0
They have used apt visual aid like UML diagrams and screen shots,0
"No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving.",0
Necessary diagrams are included.,0
The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.,0
Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.,0
"Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.",0
The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.,0
The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.,0
The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.,0
test plans walk through necessary functionalities.,0
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,0
A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.,0
Yes this is done very well.,0
"They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.",0
The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. ,0
The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. ,0
"Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.",0
"Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.",0
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to  explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.,0
The authors have explained enough about the changes,0
"The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.",0
Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a  Very well written document. Good job team.,0
"They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.   ",0
The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. ,0
"The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan.

The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings. ",0
"the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.",0
"Yes, the design seems to be sound.",0
The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by  listing its advantages.,0
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. ,0
"The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery.

As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.",0
"Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.",0
"This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.",0

Yes. The figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view. The columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable. Good work :),0
"Yes, the team added visual aids like UML diagrams, screen shots, code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. Well done!",0
This team  used great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,0
"There are multiple visual  elements that improve the readability of the document. Screenshots of the UI tables help with the illustration of  the required changes. Furthermore,  the UML diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows.",0
The team has added good number of mock UIs and UML diagram and clearly explains the code follow. All of them are self-explanatory and needs no improvement,0
diagram is added. ,0
No visulization is necessary for this project,0
You have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good,0
The design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made.,0
There is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc.,0
Yes it includes test plan. It is very well written and will test the functionalities.,0
"Test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality, In the test plan i see the functionalities explained l",0
"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.",0
the test plan is thorough. ,0
Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. ,0
they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer,0
"The authors have very well explained all the changes that need to be done with the help of proper problem statement, the files that require modifications, the current and the required state.",0
"I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.",0
Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.,0
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics",0
yes they have explained it very well.,0
The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.,0
The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.,0
Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. ,0
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",0
"Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time. This project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered. The project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented.",0
"Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. ",0
yes it does based on the proposed solution.,0
"The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.",0
The design doc is sound and I believe  no design patterns are required for this project.,0
The design appears sound.,0
"Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.",0
"The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.",0
"Yes, the design appears to be simple. ",0
"Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",0
"Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate  a web service which returns a result in JSON format.",0
yes it does appear to be simple as possible.,0
The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.,0
The design appears very simple.,0
The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.,0
the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution,0
The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.,0
"The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation",0
Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.,0
"Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.",0
The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.,0
"yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of  the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.",0
"The authors have explained the changes made to the system.

The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.",0
"Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",0
The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.,0
They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.,0
The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.,0
"The  use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.",0
"yes, very well explained.",0
"The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.",0
They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.,0
The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.,0
Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.,0
Design seems correct.,0
"Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.",0
yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.,0
System is well defined ,0
The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.,0
The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. ,0
"The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.",0
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.",0
Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. ,0
Design is simple and easy to understand.,0
Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. ,0
"Yes, the design is simple and easy to understand. I can easily know what they will do through their doc.",0
The design appears to be very simple and well written. They have explained the use case diagram very well. also they have added visualizations.,0
"yes, the design is simple and easy to understand ",0
The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy,0
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",0
I think more tests can be added,0
"From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.",0
"Yes, design involves google charts API  and seems very simple.",0
Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.,0
Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.,0
"Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.",0
They have worked on their weak  point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.,0
"The sample data visualizations is good.

The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.",0
"The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.",0
Test cases have been added. ,0
The team already has mockups for their design.,0
"The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.",0
Really good visualization provided.,0
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,0
"According to the team ""The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests""  but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using  the  RSpec  testing framework. Overall, the test plan sounds good ",0
No tests are required for the project as stated,0
This team did not require any tests.,0
"The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.",0
The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.,0
Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.,0
The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.,0
"Yes, the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written.",0
Yes they have,0
"Yes, this is the best design I have reviewed. It has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great, and it's very well made with very good design details and objectives.

It also included the current scenario and a typical score table.

It should be great if there's an expected final outcome visualization as well.",0
Yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system. The process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the MVC files. Good job,0
The problem and the changes needed is explained clearly,0
"Yes, they explained a lot with two steps.",0
I really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement.,0
"All problem statements have been explained, this time including an elaborate test plan.",0
"Yes, the author explained the plan clearly. The steps and the files need to be modified are listed.",0
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",0
Yes it looks sound,0
"The design is sound. It completely follows the instructions.

It also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps.

I think it follows the DRY principle, because it uses existing implementations, fully understood the existing implementations, and added the functions above.

I think it should also follow the factory pattern, although not shown in the design doc.",0
Yes the system is well designed and the UI looks neat as well. They have put effort into the UI thinking process.,0
"Although the design provided is clear, there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended. ",0
The design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as I am concerned. And as mentioned earlier I would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well.,0
The document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow. They have explained each and everything stepwise.,0
"Yes, the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. Maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document.",0
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",0
the design is simple,0
"The design is both simple and clear.

It should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. Both as a final examination and a testing.",0
"Yes the design is as simple as possible. However they have only described the proposed design. They could have provided simple mock ups or samples,",0
"Yes, pretty simple. Great job!",0
"The design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge. Not a lot of files needed to be changed, signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex.",0
"The document is well explained. Thus, it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. However, more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more.",0
"The design is as simple as possible, and described in a straightforward manner.",0
The design seems simple and feasible.,0
Necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation.,0
"Yes, appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots",0
"There are visual aids included with the design, depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes.",0
The authors provide some screenshots which make their project more clear. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their solutions.,0
"I see test cases properly defined, but the test plan is missing.",0
Yes the test plan is included.I think the tests will cover all scenarios,0
The testing appears to be pretty rigorous. They have taken into account cases when TA/instructor's scores should be excluded. The test cases could have been better described.,0
Team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. It will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller/view separately.,0
"Yes, there is a detailed test plan for this project. Not only basic features testing but also other more testing.",0
The test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios. I am personally happy with the given test-plan.,0
They have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient. I think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project.,0
The design includes the test plan.,0

"Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! ",0
No changes has been done,0
"Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!",0
"  The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",0
The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team,0
1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.,0
"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes.

I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.",0
The authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes. All of the changes are well defined and precise.,0
"Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.

"yeah, Their  proposed design includes workflow, initial step, and subsequent steps. It was easy to follow their design. Their solution appears to be sound.",0
"Yes, I am  surprised that they have already finished the project. ",0
  The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.,0

As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,0
  Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,0
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,0
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",0
"The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand.",0
"Yes, the  uml  diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",0
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,0
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,0
"They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios for the project in their test.

Their test plan is highly appreciative.",0
  The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role.

"The main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality. This is a great idea. It is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e.g. not reinventing the wheel. One suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class, from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied, is not directly used as  this would be a more DRY approach. In a case if this is not possible, then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful.",0
No diagrams are required for this project.,0
"Since it is a Mozilla project testing is not necessary, but the previous design documentation does touch upon the specifics of testing how an OffScreenCanvas is rendered.",0
Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. ,0
they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer,0
"I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.",0
Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.,0
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics",0
yes they have explained it very well.,0
The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.,0
The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.,0
Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. ,0
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",0
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,0
"Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. ",0
yes it does based on the proposed solution.,0
"The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.",0
The design doc is sound and I believe  no design patterns are required for this project.,0
The design appears sound.,0
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",0
"Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.",0
"The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.",0
"Yes, the design appears to be simple. ",0
"Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",0
"Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate  a web service which returns a result in JSON format.",0
yes it does appear to be simple as possible.,0
The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.,0
The actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned. But the files to be modified seem appropriate.,0
The design appears very simple.,0
The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.,0
The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.,0
the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution,0
The program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.,0
UML diagram explains the changes.,0
"Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",0
"The  use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.",0
"yes, very well explained.",0
The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.,0
The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.,0
Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. ,0
I think more tests can be added,0
"The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.",0
Test cases have been added. ,0
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,0
"the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.",0
The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.,0
the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not.,0
The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.,0
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and  displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",0
Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.,0

Necessary diagrams are included.,0
The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.,0
Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.,0
"Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.",0
The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.,0
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza  deployement  to show where the changes would be visible",0
The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.,0
The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.,0
test plans walk through necessary functionalities.,0
"Yes, a good test plan is also included",0
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,0
A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.,0
Yes this is done very well.,0
"They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.",0
The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. ,0
The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. ,0
"Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.",0

Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.,0
The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!,0
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Test Plan"" and the ""Proposed Design"" section. ",0
"In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! ",0
The design was well explained in this  design  doc.,0
"Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. ",0
yes!,0

The design seems simple and clear.,0
very clear,0
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.

Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.

No suggestions required.",0
flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation.,0
Great use of mock ups. Really appreciate it.,0
"Yes, they have added mock UI screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do.",0
Yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow. Different diagrams are provided for different issues. One of the best wikis I have seen,0
Very good use of Class and Sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow. It clearly conveys the thought process of authors and the overall design.,0
Lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail.,0
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.  

 ",0
The team has added their mock UI which shows they have thought about the changes and modification. Mock UIs of the screen shows they are halfway the project. ,0
"The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI  with indication on it make it more useful.",0
"Yes, design is informative. Change proposal is detailed. It describes well about how changes are to be implemented.",0
The diagram is perfect and clear,0
"Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations.

Great work. No suggestions are required.",0
"The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities.

But nothing mentioned on how they will write.",0
The test plan is comprehensive.,0
They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.,0
The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.,0
"The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.",0
"I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. ",0
An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc.,0
yes the test coverage seems good,0
The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.,0
"Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.",0
Yes. ,0
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the y",0
The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.,0
The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.,0
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",0
Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.,0
"The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.",0
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",0
It is sound.,0
Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.,0
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",0
The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.,0
"Yes, simple straightforward solution.

 ",0
Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language.,0
The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.,0
The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.,0
"Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job  

 ",0
The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.,0
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.",0
The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.,0
mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.,0
"There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document.

Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.",0
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,0
"A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.",0
The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. ,0
Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.,0
"Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language.",0
The team explained  everything required and not leave anything behind.,0
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Implementation"" section. ",0

Yes the required changes for the reviews is explained clearly. The design for each required change is also explained in depth now.,0
The authors have clearly mentioned the changes to be made using Problem Statement and Use Case Diagram.,0
Yes the author has made a great attempt to explain the changes by trying to explain the changes required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the changes were implemented by giving screenshots of the changes.,0
The documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly. They have  described  the functionality change in bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the sub parts required to achieve the main functionality in simple terms. ,0
I like the part where the peer review has been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score.,0
The design appears to followed appropriate  principles and patterns.,0
"The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  

Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement.",0
Yes,0
Yes the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner,0
The flow and UML  diagrams are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow. addition of detailed use case helps support the diagram,0

"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it. Hence, it is easy to understand.",0
"Application flow, use case diagram are both very useful to describe the changes,",0
Yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood.,0
The use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the changes made to the system.,0
The chart and diagrams are well done and help explain how the code will work.,0
Basic UML used,0
Some UI screenshots are added along with design diagrams which describe the system. The UI or mock UI helps in better understanding,0
"The visualizations seem to be complete. The team has included an application flow diagram, a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look. So, in my opinion, good job done!",0
"The UML diagrams are  detailed and explained well.

Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.",0
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams for every actor along with the UML diagram of the student and instructor. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.   ,0

The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,0

Yes the approach is explained in detail.,0
Yes. The design is clear and the details are succinct.,0
The authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section. The problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student's reviews public.

The design is proper.,0
"Confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews, I was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature.",0
"I am not convinced with the ""similar_assignments"" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.  

According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into.",0
The design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality. The issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner.,0
Simple design,0
"The  steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed. as stated above, the approach discusses the step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation.",0
Design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible.,0
The design is concised and clear. Only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications.,0
"For as difficult a problem as linking assignments from one year to the next is, they present an admirably simple design.",0
It is simple enough and also achieves the required features,0
"The design  looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as - What if a student makes his/her review public, this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private?",0
The design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal. The authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue. ,0
"The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.",0
The team has not used any class diagram.,0
some mock UI where this is going to be implemented would be helpful,0
"I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work.",0
There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.,0
No test cases,0
The test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process. This could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios.,0
The flowcharts included in the design document clearly explain the changes that need to be done.,0
The design document includes proper visualization. It included appropriate flow charts and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project.,0
They provide pictures of their sound waves.,0
"Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The whole implementation plan is very well written which clearly explains how the team is planing to work on project. The idea of including screenshots which explains how the functionality will look like once all the implementation is done is what I liked the most.

Suggestion: Team should include test plan in the doc.The purpose of project should be explained more clearly. Overall, nice work!",1
"The team has well documented the problem statement and the details of the fix which is required. However, they have not included any design plan or test plan which could address the approach they have planned.",1
"  The document is simple to read and has the details mentioned for the the project purpose , the design of their implementation but they haven't included the test plan",1
"The design document has the required design and implementation plan. However, it isn't uploaded as a Wiki but as a PDF. This can be inconvenient for grading and is also a lot harder to modify for the team.",1
"First of all, the doc is not a wiki page, which does not meet the requirement",1
The background and the implementation plan is provided with detail. The files to be modified for each objective of the project is also stated. Testing plan is not stated.,1
The document seems to be complete except the test plan. It would be better to include a test plan in the document.,1
"The purpose of the project seems quite clear. The team has explicitly mentioned all the requirements that has been expected of them along with the ways to implement said requirements.

There is no testing plan however. They should include that and then the document would be good to go.",1
"Good work but I find following missing for completeness,

a. table of content

b. current design and proposed changes  

c. integration of new features in design  

d. use case diagrams  

e test plan    

 ",1
"The problem statement and implementation approaches are very clearly explained with screenshots.  

Missing items:

Test plan

UML diagrams",1
  The explanations seem to be okay. Couldn't fully understand what they meant by 'use proper polymorphism to handle ...' in the problem statement part 2(b)i.,1
The team has not proposed any design for the suggested changes.,1
I think their designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that can be simplified.,1
"detailed design is missing, the document covers only the screen shots and high level overview of what needs to be done",1
"Code level implementation details are not provided.

But, the approach looks clean.",1
"This is one area where the authors could have improved. Even though there is a good amount of textual description and images, the authors could have added a snapshot of the code changes that they wanted to propose. This would make it clear as to the exact changes that you propose and further help answer this question.",1
"The team has added the mock up screens which helps to understand the proposed look and feel of the project implementation. However, there are no UML diagrams or design diagrams added for the project, due to which its difficult to understand their approach on fixing the issue.",1
"  Here the team has only included screenshot relating to how the UI of the system should look like which gives a idea of its appearance , However , They haven't given any UML diagrams to represent the flow of their work for example a flow chart relating to how their functionalities would co-ordinate.",1
There are mock-ups for the final result of the team's changes. However I would like some UML like diagram or some flowchart explaning how a user gets to a particular point. I don't know if it's me or maybe my lack of familiarity with the Bacui interface but I found the navigation part a bit difficult to follow.,1
  UML diagrams not present but rest of the document seems feasible,1
Yes screen shots are helpful but the document missing flow control diagrams ,1
The doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. You might want to add a test plan right away to go for a test-driven development.,1
The team has very well explained the Goals and separation of concerns. The team could have 'proposed' a way to test the implementation.,1
"Document explains the problem well. One thing I would like to explained more is how strategy pattern being used will help reduce the code than the amount of code currently present, But i guess that will be explained better once the teams gets to implementing stuff and knows a bit more about the design.",1
The project goals are stated in a simple and precise manner. The design document is readable and easy to understand from. They have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the refactoring. They can include or add file names which they are about to change.,1
"The authors have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution. I could easily understand the problem statement from the write-up. Well written.

However, the test plan is missing from the design document.  

Suggestion :  

You might want to add few success test cases and few edge test cases for removing reports.

 ",1
The doc is complete except the Test Plan. A test plan would make it complete. ,1
"The design document coherently describes the project details including it's purpose and design. This helps to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goals. However, it could be improved by providing the test cases that have been carried out to get to the present state. ",1
"The project design and project purpose parts are pretty detailed. However, for the test part, the authors only state that they will write tests for the new controller but no detailed test plan.",1
"The authors have divided the design into sub-tasks which shows that they are very clear about their approach.

As per the problem statement, the added functionality seems complete to me.

Suggestion:    

You could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work.",1
"The design incorporates the basic functionalities required that include refactoring the review_mapping_controller file, to extrapolate it's features to the reports_controller file. It must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the reports from response_report method to the controller file.",1
The authors have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategies using a UML diagram. The could add CRC cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.,1
"  

The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions.

It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.",1
The changes proposed by the team have been specified in detail providing general requirements about each goal. But it does not make any specifics of the code that could help to infer the proposals with the functionalities. ,1
"The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful.",1
The explanation is clear. It would be better if the authors explain more about the strategy pattern they will use.,1
The document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class ReportStrategy.,1
  Not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question.,1
"It appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation, which is a good design.

I think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller, i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add.",1
The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.,1
The design seems pretty good. The only drawback is the test plan is missing.,1
"The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.",1
The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.,1
"  More or less an A for effort, but I don't know if the UML is fine with so little in it because we don't care about what those classes do, or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors.",1
"The teams implementation of a UML diagram seems to be a good way of representing the changes planned.The diagram could have been detailed with regards to the classes that are being added and modified. There should be attributes of each class , then the methods that are added or changed with the type of inputs to these methods and return types of these methods.",1
"the authors have made it clear by including mock-up screen of the proposed solution.  

They have used class uml diagram for the newly identified sub-classes and hence, I think that they have made adequate use of visual aids.

Suggestion:

They can add use cases for the new feature.",1
The UML diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods,1
A brief  description for the class level implementation would be better.,1
The doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. You might want to add a test plan right away to go for a test-driven development.,1

"  Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.",1
The authors have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategies using a UML diagram. The could add CRC cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.,1

The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions.

It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.",1
The changes proposed by the team have been specified in detail providing general requirements about each goal. But it does not make any specifics of the code that could help to infer the proposals with the functionalities. ,1
"The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful.",1
The explanation is clear. It would be better if the authors explain more about the strategy pattern they will use.,1
The document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class ReportStrategy.,1
"The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.",1
"It appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation, which is a good design.

I think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller, i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add.",1
The design seems pretty good. The only drawback is the test plan is missing.,1
"  More or less an A for effort, but I don't know if the UML is fine with so little in it because we don't care about what those classes do, or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors.",1
"The teams implementation of a UML diagram seems to be a good way of representing the changes planned.The diagram could have been detailed with regards to the classes that are being added and modified. There should be attributes of each class , then the methods that are added or changed with the type of inputs to these methods and return types of these methods.",1
"the authors have made it clear by including mock-up screen of the proposed solution.  

They have used class uml diagram for the newly identified sub-classes and hence, I think that they have made adequate use of visual aids.

Suggestion:

They can add use cases for the new feature.",1
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  

Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the  proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1
"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.",1
proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how,1
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1
"The proposed solution  sounds good. They haven't really mentioned  the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few  html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the  chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1
Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1
NO UML diagram,1
"Though the UI mockup explains the functionalities, it could have been more legible.",1
No uml  diagrams present - can create a simple use case diagram to indicate the flow of the solution,1
This is a very innovative idea. Well explained design document. Files needed to be changes are also mentioned.,1
"Some aspects of the designs are not clearly mentioned:

eg: After the author adds new questions for the second review, how will the instructor validate if the right questions that satisfy the requirements of the project are being asked. ",1
UML diagram is missing. Though the modified UI is explained.,1
"It is well written document , at this point most of the teams will be getting ready on approaching the problem , so team is yet to fillout  implementation plan, remaining parts are well written.",1
Would be good to include high level overview of changes made in the files. ,1
Included a kind of mock UI/Lo-Fi diagram to shown how the uiwould like which is great.,1
All good components of a design document are present. It would be nice to have the UI mockups without handwriting that may make it hard to read.,1
"As mentioned previously, the UI mockups are decent but  don't necessarily convey the overall design concept to those not familiar with the expertiza system. ",1
The author has mentioned which files have to be changed but no mention has been made of how they are going to be changed. Could have expanded a bit more on that aspect,1
The UI mockups uploaded are very unclear as they are just pictures of hand drawn designs. This too could have worked had the diagrams and the text inside them been clear. I can understand the flow however the components are tough to decipher.,1
The planned design looks complicated as there is a lot of data and variable transfer between classes. This could have been simplified a bit.,1
"Yes it states the plan, design well. Testing can be better represented in terms of whether its UI testing or Automated tests etc.",1
"The hand drawn diagrams are good enough to explain the problem to others , next time they can update it with  the actual page once its done.",1
"Well, all the important points have been mentioned, like problem statement, test plan, etc. Though, the test plan must include how the proposed solution is going to be achieved which they have not mentioned.",1
"They have explained their implementation through UI mockups. Well, they are not quite understandable, but for the first submission this could work.",1
"They used UI mockups to explain their implementation. Though, some UML diagrams like USE case would be preferred over this.",1
"Good work on problem statement and implementation ideas. However, screenshots could have added. LoFi sketches and flowcharts missing. ",1
Reference section missing.,1
"Could have added UML diagrams, LoFi sketches and flowcharts.",1
The document is well written Just that a UML  diagram or something  similar  could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand.,1
The problem statement could have been elaborated a bit more. One line doesnt  seem enough here.,1
"No diagrams or tables were provided. However, adding those pictures was a good idea.",1
There were few hand-made diagrams posted however I feel used of some other high-level UML diagrams and screenshots would have been better.,1
The project's purpose and issues are well stated. But the project design have not been included.,1
"The project design and the testing plans are well laid out.

Solution part does not have any description in it, says it will be given in the detailed design.

Could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram.",1
"The project writeup is not complete at this moment, as there are a lot of things missing. Like what the team plan to do, and what concretey are its testing techniques. It only mentions the problem statement, and an overview of testing.",1
Seems like all parts of the design document need more details.,1
Only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution. Please add design and UML diagrams.,1
"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and  the solution approach.  

  

 ",1
"Implementation details are missing, but the testing plan is ready. ",1
UML diagrams and the solution proposed by the authors to solve the issues is missing.,1
The doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. Seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issues identified.,1
Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc),1
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.,1
"The project purpose is explained with examples but no design or plan to implement is given.  

Again under the Test Plan section, a generic  method is given but is not specific to the project. ",1
"The design doc  for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions.",1
"It does list out all the functionality, but there seem to be no solutions for them.

Only a basic layout is present.

An insight into the solutions to be implemented would be suggested.",1
There is no description of what the team plans to implement.,1
"All functionalities required are in the design doc, but no content is provided.",1
"No, their sections Solution Design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc. Only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon.  

 ",1
The design document has mentioned the issues which need to be fixed but why these issues are occurring and what will the solution be is missing.,1
"Yes, the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.",1
Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc),1

"Have covered almost all the issues, it would have been better if an implementation plan was provided.",1
"The author hasn't mentioned any prospective changes. So, this couldn't be looked in to.",1
"There are no solutions proposed. Just the issues are listed and explained.

A possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution.",1
The author has not suggested any changes as of now.,1
"no implementation proposed in the design document, only placeholders. Need more detail for it.",1
No changes proposed.,1
"Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.  

It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  

They  have even yet to work on the most important part  that is figuring out the solution. ",1
"Clearly defined bugs and problem statements, but no implementation details given. So it is hard to judge this criterion",1
The changes are not yet proposed.,1
Did not find much info on the Design,1
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.,1
Author has not proposed any changes.,1
"Since no  solution has been proposed yet, this couldn't be reviewed.",1
"There were no such solutions listed on the basis of which I could suggest some better solutions.

A couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.",1
The author has not written any plans about the implementation. It only states the problem statement. The author needs to do more work in the writeup.,1
"no design proposed, can not check any mistake of the design decision.",1
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,1
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  

They haven't even defined an application flow.  

1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. As per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design. ",1
"no implementation details given, so cannot say how they ",1
No details of the proposed design.,1
Did not find much info on the Design,1
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions. No design were added in the documentation.,1

It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.",1
No visual aids have been  provided by the author.,1
no visual aids in the design document.,1
No UML diagram.,1
"No diagrams, have been mentioned and they have said that they would implement a diagram in the final design doc and thus that part of the project has been left in the air.  

1. No diagram present.

2. No conventional flow since no diagrams present.  

3. Not only no high level but no diagrams are are even abstractly specified.",1
There were no flow or UML diagrams.,1
Did not find much info on the Design,1
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions. No use of visual aids/ diagrams as of now.,1
UML mockup and tables are absent. ,1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
"The design document was clear and concise; however, I would like to see more details on how routes.rb and the views will be edited to pull static strings from the en.yml file. The test plan section is not detailed enough.",1
"All parts are presented, but need little fore explanation in test plan part.",1
"I think technical design lacks details. the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work, where will the string be kept.

what are the effective changes required across the project

test plan should have more tests

 ",1
"The document shows how they will be using the API. However, since it is initial they have not clearly mentioned the functionality required.",1
The team have suggested reasonable changes to address the problem  statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.,1
"The explanations are done well but they could be more thorough. Why is the internationalization API and Google Translate needed? Also, will you use a script to edit the views? How would you do that? It seems like too much work to do manually.",1
The explanation for changes are just an overview of what needs to be done and does not focusses on the changes to be made in the files.,1
need to edit test plan  and add more test cases.,1
changes could be explained in details. i think that is missing a bit. ,1
No code is mentioned to be checked ,1
"Lower level design changes are missing.  

Authors have only talked about config changes.  

No mention if the db requires any changes ",1
"The UML diagrams are missing, but they are compensated by suitable explanations. I could follow it very easily.",1
No diagrams present to explain behaviour design.,1
"nice mockup for another language, it is clean. The menu bar for translated language screen is still in English, I assume it is just a careless mistake when make the mockup.",1
There are mock-ups of the end result. But there are no other UML diagrams. There should have been some UML diagrams to help explain their design better as well as the flow of the implementation.,1
The only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page. More UML based diagrams could increase understandability.,1
"No UML diagrams present.  

Suggestions: Although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like, the team could have mentioned a use case diagram, or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. ",1
"The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.",1
"There is no mention of testing, also code change related details have not been included.

Otherwise the document is very good.",1
"test plan is specified, but UML is missing. They have added the ER diagram though, which i don't think is required here.",1
"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.",1
The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.,1
"The design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow.

But the approach section  doesn't have any technical implementation  details. It just explains the flow that is going to be implemented.

Test plan is missing.",1
"Project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation. However, the test plan is not stated in the documentation.",1
"The project purpose and possible solutions are clearly described in this design doc. However, the author only talked about the solution but no exactly  what they need to do to implement the solutions. Also, there is no testing plan.",1
The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.,1
search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.,1
"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.",1
"The explanation of changes is good enough that it states what all needs to be added/re-implemented, but it does not elaborate on some technical aspects.",1
it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.,1
"The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. ",1
Team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. Could have given more detail on Design using UML diagrams and Files invovled in the Project,1
"The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the ""Search for Reviews"" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. The authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately. ",1
"The authors explain the project pretty well, they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different sets. However, the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge cases.",1
"Code snippets are not mentioned, but design is properly done.",1
They didn't add the code change details or the files in which they might work. That's still fine as those details can be filled once the implementation is done.,1
can't say in what file they'll make change as its not specified in the document. You can add what changes you'll be making and explain a little more for better understanding.,1
"The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.",1
"The author has not yet presented how the work is going to be done, as work on the project might not have started yet.",1
The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.,1
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible.",1
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1
"Just one ER diagram.

Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.",1
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little  high level and does not completely  explain the flow of the system.",1
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1
The write-up is very minimal. I think it should elaborate made ,1
"The project purpose is stated in detail, in the Introduction part. Starting from the background and problem statement ( to improve the quality of report views""). The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed.

As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps.

The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the impl",1
"It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups",1
"The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view.",1
The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza  since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.,1
"The design doc  for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions

 ",1
"The design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed. However, it looks a bit incomplete to me.

Suggestions:

Try adding what were your proposed approaches and a clear reasoning as to why did you choose a particular approach.

You can simply remove the statement on Expertiza, as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it.

 ",1
"The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics.

General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which  will be addressed by the project.

The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project.

The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents.",1
"The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.



 ",1
"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. ",1
"Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement.",1
"Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available.

I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.",1
"Please add more details about the solution.

How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.",1
"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields.

Suggestions:

Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.

  

 ",1
"  Yes, their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. But how the team will achieve the few not so straight-forward sorting such as the one indicated in ,author feedback report, is not clear to conclude, their approach will achieve the intended functionality

  

 ",1
"The explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view, and needs further drilling down into the implementation.",1
"The changes being proposed including the modification of 6 files: submission, team title, view, review-report, feedback report, and teammate review report. I think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. But more details needs to be stated:

How should we change this list_submissions.html.erb file? Should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern?

In which file will the sorting be implemented? there does have information on how to sort by JQuery, but there's not yet information, in terms of which file, which part needs to be changed.   ",1
could use more detail,1
"The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.",1
Solutions have been proposed. How they are going to do that is not mentioned.,1
"The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes.

Suggestions:

I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes. ",1
The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a  tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more  details to further clarity  the solution. ,1
"It states the internal jQuery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting, again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution.",1
"As mentioned above, the design part is pretty weak for a writeup, and needs to be further worked upon.",1
"I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.",1
"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  

Suggestion:

You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it.

Query:

Do you plan on creating a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.",1
"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.",1
"1)       The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable",1
how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use?,1
No UML diagram.,1
"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. ",1
"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.",1
no visuals at all,1
"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.",1
"The authors have not included any diagrams.

Though the purpose and proposed changes are understood, the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1
"Although screenshots are available on the Projects page, it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too.",1
No use of any visual aids.,1
"There are no diagrams present.

It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.",1
Did not find any diagrams in the Wiki.,1
"Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes.

Suggestions:

You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes.

You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design.

  

  

 ",1
"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.",1
NO UML diagram,1
"  This seems complete to me. They have the introduction with a purpose and problem, a ui mockup, and use cases. It does seem odd that the use cases are listed in the test plan.",1
"The design document contains some extra information, such as a whole paragraph about expertiza, which I think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part.",1
"The project purpose seems to be only a user story, that says what's the deficiencies of te corrent  issues and a terse solution. I wonder if that's comprehensive enough. I would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed  in a lower level.  

There' only a high-level solution , and which files to change for the project design. They are not detailed enough. I would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change, when to do the change if the changes are inter-dependent.

There's no testing plans yet. But I think that should be stated.",1
  Neither the project purpose nor the testing plan or the project design is given. The project just states what are the proposed solutions.,1
"The Document mentions the problem statement, and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it. There is no reference to code or functions that might need some modification. Some design talk would be nice.",1
"The design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. There are no sections for project purpose, project design, or project testing. Consider adding these sections to give order to the document. Also, red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some.",1
Provided link is not the wiki link. Not a good documentation,1
Could have been more descriptive,1
The testing plan is not proper. Though the document is nicely presented it does not concentrate on all areas. I would suggest to systematically describe each step.,1
"The team states all the problems included in this project and provide the solutions for them. However, the authors didn't provide enough introduction about what the project is. The problems was not explained clear enough and tough to understand. No test plan provided.",1
"The document lists all the problem and possible solutions, which is good. However, there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions, for example, you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the  files need to be changed. Also, the testing plan should be added.",1
"The design includes all the functionalities required in the documentation:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit# the main goal: to let the TA be able to review any team that has submitted the assignment is well stated.

I think some screenshots or other pictures will be more helpful  while explaining the functionalities.",1
"  There is no design given per se but from what I can understand from the document, their proposed system covers all required issues.",1
Yes they do incoroporate  but very bad look and feel of the document and hard to understand,1
The functionality needs to be explained a bit more,1
"The design explains what all is to be implemented.However, there is no way it shows how it is going to be implemented.",1
"The document is a little bit strange, it doesn't show what the design of the project but list the concerns during the design process. It is hard to tell if the team covers all the functions, but from those problems. I can find they design part of the functions.",1
"The explanations are good. Separating cases to cases and discuss them one by one is a good strategy.  

However, none of them is explained in detail. They are all a little bit terse. After reading it, I still have the following questions:

1. how to change the list_submissions.html.erb? What are the functions that is already implemented? The four cases in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not.

2. ""The feature as understood from the past project is that Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality)"" I did not quite understand this sentence. What's its relation too the four cases proposed here?

3. the problem of "" response controllder checks 2 times and should be reduced to 1"", there's not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation.

  

 ",1
"Changes proposed are adequate, but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. It is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this ""Maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls""",1
I find the information and solutions provided inadequate as they fail to explain me the solution. also missing diagrams,1
"Since, they have not come up with a perfect solution, it seems they have been working on that.",1
"The authors clearly explain about the issues and possible solutions. However, there is no description about the technical aspect and what all tools will be used.",1
"The intended changes are not stated clearly. Some solutions are also ambiguous, the team only said that they would change some files or look more codes, but they didn't say how they will change.",1
"The author seems not sure about exactly what solution they need to use (problem 5). Except that, everything is clear.",1
"5), More effort should be expended on the design.

The solution is too high-end, abstract. Also, some screenshots being added would be a lot more helpful. And addressing the above issues will also increase the readability",1
"There is an ""Assign grade"" link for everyone, but only ""Perform review"" for certain teams.",1
Nothing related to technical part or classes is mentioned,1
There are not enough information to help me understand  what the design looks like.,1
"The design seems pretty good, but the solutions are a little bit unspecific. It would be better if there are more explanations about how to implement the solutions so that the reviews can give you more feedback. ",1
"The UML diagrams are missing, but they are compensated by the sequence of steps, which is easy to follow.",1
No visual aid present in the doc but they have given a link which provides visual help,1
"There's no visual aids.  

I think other than a screenshot of a finalized result possible, a workflow diagram will also be useful the work design.",1
  Visual aids are missing entirely. No class diagrams are provided either. Tip: you could've provided simple charts or ER diagrams for the design,1
There aren't many visual aids used. It may be a good idea to do some mockups for this project.,1
There is no visual aid.,1
I liked that instead of stating all the problems at once and then stating their solutions the design doc tackles in one at a time. Still there wsa no visual aid provided for the project.,1
No visuals are us,1
"The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined.

The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify.

The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.",1
Project purpose and testing plan are nicely explained in the design doc. It would be better if the project design is more elaborateive.,1
"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty.

Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how.

I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.

  

 ",1
The design document mentions nothing about evaluation of how long the API takes to return with a JSON.,1
Few information is missing like specification on NLP and how exactly the implementation would be. Idea is fine but add more details to it.,1
As mentioned before the document is good for most of the part except that key aspects of the implementation are missing which leaves me wondering about how exactly they are going to do this. I would like more details on this so called 'API',1
The design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly.,1
"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  

They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one.

Suggestion:

You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.",1
The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.,1
The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1
"The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it.

Suggestion:

You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.

 ",1
More explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added. Could have also added technologies to be used.,1
"A simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working.  

Suggestion: I feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. For example what different possible methods will be implemented. Or how the web service will be used, or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection. ",1
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,1
"  Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go.

As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?",1
"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound.

There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.",1
"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however i feel the author is on track to make the right changes by looking at the files intended to be modified.",1
More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1
As the design document section is missing I cannot review the quality of their proposed design.,1
Not much has been talked about the methods to be added. but the files specified seems right,1
"I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system.

Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention    ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ",1
The mockups do explain where the team intends to add the 'Analyze' button. It however makes no explanation of where the analysis will be shown.,1
UML diagrams are not included,1
UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.,1
"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like  volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  

The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  

The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.",1
"The team has used screenshots  to explain their plan, but haven't used any diagrams, like UML, or flowchart to describe their flow.",1
"screenshots are added, which are enough to tell what they will be doing in the front end. a bit more can be explained on backend part by giving code snippets.",1
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,1
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1
"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth.

Suggestion:

You might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write-up",1
"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.",1
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",1
The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.,1
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1
"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki.

The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do.

The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding.

The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing.

Suggestion:  

The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc...

the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.",1
"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.",1
"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.",1
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  

Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1
"Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.  

Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance.

suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",1
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1
The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.,1
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",1
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",1
the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.,1
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the  proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1
"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.",1
proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how,1
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1
"The proposed solution  sounds good. They haven't really mentioned  the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few  html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1
The author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual changes are to be made is not yet clear as work on the project might not have started yet.,1
"Since the graphs will be constructed dynamically for the entire class as whole, the impact on response time needs to be considered in case there are a large number of entries to process as this could involve database calls.",1
The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.,1
"The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system.

Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. ",1
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.,1
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the  chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1
"The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose.

Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.",1
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1
The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza  view.,1
Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1
NO UML diagram,1
"A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  

Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. ",1
There are no visual aids to support the document.I would suggest them to design a flow chart that can show their design planning.,1
No diagrams provided.,1
No diagrams included in the document. Adding some diagrams to explain what the system is and how the design will look like will be better.,1
"There is a webpage linked which is helpful, but I do not see any other visual aids. It would be better to have some screenshots to help the reader understand your project.",1
"Testing plan not included.

 ",1
The sections included for this design document cover the intent of the group to find and solve the bugs required for their project. I am not sure that the Introduction section reads as an introduction but more as a project problem statement. If this is an introduction more should be included as to what is the purpose of the project and what this current introduction content means. ,1
The wiki page is prepared with a good research on the topic. Just test plans are left to be added.,1
Test Plan is not present.,1
Include testing plan if possible,1
"The team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and  providing their proposed solutions.

The purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several  independent issues.

The problem is that testing plan is missing from the project. I would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality (e.g. one spec per issue) and then elaborating from there.

Moreover, while  fixing some issues like  #1008 and #1065 consists of a  small  modification to the existing code, there are other cases where the design decisions are not  provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns.

The  document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive.",1
Everything looks great as they have added the uml diagrams ad explained everything in detail. Test plan is missing which can be added as they are  solving a lot of issues in this project.,1
The document is very well-written. Just the test plan is missing.,1
Project purpose and project design are present and really detailed! Test plan was absent though...,1
"The design document is extremely well written. The project purpose is mentioned, although it  looks similar to what is already mentioned in  the Google design document. I would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project, how this project is helpful to the system ? Why are these changes/project necessary ?

Additionally I would also suggest the team to add a test plan section to their documentation. Any bugs fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge cases as well as core fucntionality. ",1
"The project design is well presented and solves all issues. However, testing plan and project purpose are missing. You could have given at-least a basic high level overview of testing in the end, Overall good effort!",1
The issues are addressed thoroughly. But probablty the issue on staggered deadline needs to be handled carefully the solution might cause other code effects need to cover all the individuals involved,1
"The changes proposed by the authors are reasonable, they do not introduce any clutter or inconsistencies to the code.

However,  issues #1017 and  #1072 do not have a clear solution. In one case changes to the assignment controller are proposed but it cannot be inferred how adequate  those changes will be.",1
"Its good, can be more elaborative. Also in sections where you have added the code changes, you ca add comments to the code as well for better understanding.",1
"A fix for the second and fourth issues is missing at the current moment. If this is included as in the other issues then the document will adequately propose solutions. Also, perhaps more elaboration on the 3rd fix on how the columns are not being copied over (I know the code is pasted but a simple worded explanation would be nice too).",1
"Overall work is done good.

But Explanations are bit lengthy and somewhat hard to follow.

Ther is no need to mention the existing code.Which simplymmakes the documentation lengthier.",1
"The design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system.

It can make the code smelly.

Too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored.",1
"The design is well though of however instead of writing the time difference logic, gems could have been used which are well tested and bug free.",1
"I would appreciate a little more detail on bugs #1017 and #1072, which have a flow established, but no code snippets.",1
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files.

The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"".

But for few issues you haven't added any files which you'll be modifying, only the uml is given, you can add them before the final submission.",1
"The team has provided solutions for all the issue but one. For issue#1017, the team has only provided a flow chart(description of the issue graphically) but the code which needs to be changed/added should be looked upon.  

  

Suggestion: The team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the files and the logic behind the proposed solution.",1
"The designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems.

However, the  design decisions for issues #1017 and  #1072 are missing and therefore cannot be assessed.

I would suggest  including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that  are going to be  addressed  in this project. Posting the exact solution is not necessary.",1
Flowchart is included in the document but there is no screenshot or mock-up screens. ,1
"issue 1065 uml diagram is too high level so it does not provide enough details,

Rest all diagrams follow the standards and are easy to understand.",1
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",1
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1
The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.,1
"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed.

They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.",1
"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :



Total number of commits.

Number of files changed.

Lines of Code added

Lines of code modified.

Lines of code deleted.

LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority).",1
"The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.",1
"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to  an existing controller may not be OO design.",1
Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient. ,1
"They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here.

Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes. ",1
The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.,1
"The design is well explained.

Need clarification on below:

1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.",1
"The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  

The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.",1
class level details are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc. they have mentioned use of existing gems that need investigation,1
Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.,1
"The problem statements are much detailed, but they could be more concise.

The test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation.",1
the design covers all tthe major aspects well. I feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way.,1
"The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.",1
lack of group members.   The design process is not very clear.,1
The doc focusses on eliminating the issue and does not shower any light on the design of the system.,1
"The overall quality of explanations is precise and clear.

Isssue 3 and the test plan can be addressed in more detail.

How the testing will be performed must be addressed.",1
The Issue 2 explanation ans Issue 1 solution 2 explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level. It needs to be broken down. All other descriptions are easy to follow. It would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.,1
proposed changes are well explanatory but every function change is in sign_up_sheet controller whereas there are many references present in a few models and other controllers as well,1
"The explanations given show that they have put thought into their project however in Issue 1 solution 2, they are not clear about the path ahead. They have vaguely stated that the solution might be complex.",1
"The only issue i feel is iapproach to issue 1 is a bit complex or not clear which may lead to

increasing the response time of the system.",1
"  More effort could have been expended on the design because in some places, they are not sure of the direction and just state that they might have to look into the code and discuss with the professor.",1
The UML diagrams does seems to be a bit at a high level. I couldn't get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented.,1
The diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. Suggestion : Test Plan is not so clear. Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart will make it very clear as to what you plan to test.,1
"The authors have proposed to create a view for Grade Summary with the details pertaining to the assignment grades, topics, review scores and total scores for each student which gets rendered when a 360 Assessment tab icon is clicked. This change seems logical. They have also depicted a LowFI sketch of the projected page and screenshot of a rough prototype. These changes seem logical to me. I wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited as prior work in the background. The documentation could have added specifics of the files that they wish to modify or create.",1
"The explanation is good, and they have managed to get in a prototype UI as well.

My only concern with the design is, if there are a lot of assignments the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user.",1
Got confused in between about the proposed solution,1
"The explanations are succinct. However, in the Controllers section, it is unclear which controller in expertiza project the authors are referring to. The authors could mention the name of the controller(s) they intend to change and also  possible method(s) that might be added to it. ",1
"The team has proposed a prototype where in the code might have some kinds of sorting of data.

I hope the code for this does not violate the DRY principle in any case.",1
"The authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify. So I am not in a position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly.

The design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems.  

The response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information. The team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information. Or, they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students (say under a specific course, year at a given University )

The authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions (like code modifications, file changes and UML diagrams) which can be easily incorporated by the next review.",1
They might like to elaborate more on how they plan to use the hash of students to retrieve the specific information of the assignments. For eg. what models will you be using to query the DB.,1
"The overall look of the page is well explained. However, I could not understand the back-end design  plan, as in how/where the team will be adding such features in the code.",1
"The authors view of the final result is clear, but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented. i.e what files are going to be changed.",1
"This is the only place I found the authors could improve. There is no mention of the actual files that need to be modified. They have detailed out the change that they propose, but no mention of actual files and the code change. It would be further increase the clarity of the solution if you could include that too.",1
"The diagrams are missing in the document.

Although much of it is explained in the screenshots.

A possible diagram would make the document stronger.",1
The authors have put in a good amount of effort in creating LowFI sketch (table) of the Grade Summary view with mock data. They have included a rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information. The documentation also shows the Manage Courses view which contains the 360 Assessment icon that links to the Grade Summary page. One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow as a flowchart or even useful UML diagrams for usecases.,1
Missing a UML. But loved the addition of the LoFI sketch.,1
"The team hasn't put any diagram to explain their design, they've just explained it theoretically.",1
"The doc does not have any  UML diagrams. However, the use of mockup screens are helpful to understand what the project is about.",1
"The team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. They has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. However, it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen.

The team has also proposed a short test plan on a very high level, which makes senses as this is very early level of the project, but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of self review extension.",1
The design related information is missing. The team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. They need to add UML diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.,1
"The design documents looks very crisp and clear.

The work flow, proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. Good work.

A screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better.",1
The problem statement is not clear,1
"The design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases . However, there are some things which I found incomplete. In the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition of what is meant by self review as the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the UI aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed ",1
The doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. More detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document,1
"I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general ""lite"". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or  which places they plan on making changes. ",1
"The problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. However some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. Test Plan is not stated in details. It just mentions Bullet Points. In Test Driven Development, adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing a solution as per the problem statement. This should be corrected.",1
There are no sections titled project design or project purpose.,1
"All the required part is in their design. However, maybe you can add a little more detail to your test plan.",1
The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach.,1
"In my opinion, they have included the application flow but where in Expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing. They should include the same in round 2 when they have completed the implementation.",1
"Yes, the functionalities are present.

It would have been good if the issues were listed sequentially following its solutions.",1
Yes all the requirements mentioned in the Problem Statement are considered. Also the corresponding solutions are explained . A flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution jsut like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.,1
"The authors do not have a section for proposed changes. Hence, it is not completely clear which changes they are proposing and which changes are already existing. ",1
"The explanations are good.

But a layout in the issue-solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.",1
The author has given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grades,1
"Similar to my earlier comment, I found this document lacking on details. I also don't think their explanation for deriving the ""score"" to be sufficient. Their explanation is expressed as code, not as a mathematical equation.",1
"Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.

It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  ",1
"I think you explained  the change they want to make clear, but maybe  you can state which file you want to make and  how you guys want to change that file.",1
"The team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. However, as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement.",1
They have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. But where this method is planned to be added in Expertiza  is unclear. This needs to be mentioned.,1
"It would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model.

This will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the ""smell"" category.",1
"From what I can gather, nothing sounds too complicated individually, but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very  cumbersome and complex. I don't see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues.",1
"This logic to calculate composite score :

composite score= Max score -[self review score - peer review score] is basically taking the min scores. Not sure what you are trying to achieve here . It is not a good measure to calculate composite score.",1
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  

Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  

1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Only a simple formula for composite score has been written.  

2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  

3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  

4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  

5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.",1
The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.,1
Application flow is present and done well. UML diagrams need to be added.,1
As mentioned above the flow diagram should be completely modified ,1
Diagrams are explanatory but few but I think they are sufficient,1
"Same comments as earlier. A flow chart diagram is provided, but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple. I would like to see more details about the process in an actor diagram.",1
No UML diagrams or screenshots have been included currently.,1
"There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  

1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities.

2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite.

3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail.

 ",1
No UMLs given,1
"The application flow help understands how your design work, but maybe  you can add more visual aids to help understand your design more easily.",1
The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.,1
"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed.

They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.",1
"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :



Total number of commits.

Number of files changed.

Lines of Code added

Lines of code modified.

Lines of code deleted.

LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority).",1
"The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.",1
"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to  an existing controller may not be OO design.",1
"They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here.

Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes. ",1
The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.,1
"The design is well explained.

Need clarification on below:

1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.",1
"The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  

The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.",1
class level details are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc. they have mentioned use of existing gems that need investigation,1
"  This seems complete to me. They have the introduction with a purpose and problem, a ui mockup, and use cases. It does seem odd that the use cases are listed in the test plan.",1
"The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined.

The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify.

The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.",1
"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty.

Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how.

I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.

  

 ",1
The design document mentions nothing about evaluation of how long the API takes to return with a JSON.,1
Few information is missing like specification on NLP and how exactly the implementation would be. Idea is fine but add more details to it.,1
The design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly.,1
"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  

They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one.

Suggestion:

You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.",1
The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.,1
"The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely -  the view-  app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation.

The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely -  volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.",1
The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1
"The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it.

Suggestion:

You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.

 ",1
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  

Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance.

suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",1
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",1
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",1
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the  proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1
"The proposed solution  sounds good. They haven't really mentioned  the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few  html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1
The author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual changes are to be made is not yet clear as work on the project might not have started yet.,1
"Since the graphs will be constructed dynamically for the entire class as whole, the impact on response time needs to be considered in case there are a large number of entries to process as this could involve database calls.",1
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1
Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.,1
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.,1
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the  chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1
"The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose.

Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.",1
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1
Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1
NO UML diagram,1
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,1
"  Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go.

As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?",1
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project.

The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute.

The team has done a good job on the design documentation.",1
"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound.

There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.",1
More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1
As the design document section is missing I cannot review the quality of their proposed design.,1
"I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system.

Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention    ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ",1
The mockups do explain where the team intends to add the 'Analyze' button. It however makes no explanation of where the analysis will be shown.,1
UML diagrams are not included,1
UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.,1
"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like  volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  

The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  

The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.",1
"The team has used screenshots  to explain their plan, but haven't used any diagrams, like UML, or flowchart to describe their flow.",1
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,1
It would be better to add more diagrams.,1
"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth.

The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.,1
"Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.  

Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
"The design document was clear and concise; however, I would like to see more details on how routes.rb and the views will be edited to pull static strings from the en.yml file. The test plan section is not detailed enough.",1

"The author has not yet presented how the work is going to be done, as work on the project might not have started yet.",1
"Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here",1
"Code level details are not covered in this doc.

But the high-level approach looks fine to me.",1
The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.,1
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible.",1
uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. ,1
"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.",1
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1
"Just one ER diagram.

Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.",1
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little  high level and does not completely  explain the flow of the system.",1
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1
The problem statement is not clear,1
The design related information is missing. The team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. They need to add UML diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.,1
"The design documents looks very crisp and clear.

The work flow, proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. Good work.

A screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better.",1
"The design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases . However, there are some things which I found incomplete. In the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition of what is meant by self review as the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the UI aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed ",1
The doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. More detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document,1
"I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general ""lite"". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or  which places they plan on making changes. ",1
"The problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. However some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. Test Plan is not stated in details. It just mentions Bullet Points. In Test Driven Development, adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing a solution as per the problem statement. This should be corrected.",1
There are no sections titled project design or project purpose.,1
"All the required part is in their design. However, maybe you can add a little more detail to your test plan.",1
"No, not all, but major of all functionalities.",1
Yes all the requirements mentioned in the Problem Statement are considered. Also the corresponding solutions are explained . A flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution jsut like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.,1
The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach.,1
"Yes, the functionalities are present.

It would have been good if the issues were listed sequentially following its solutions.",1
"In my opinion, they have included the application flow but where in Expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing. They should include the same in round 2 when they have completed the implementation.",1
"I think you explained  the change they want to make clear, but maybe  you can state which file you want to make and  how you guys want to change that file.",1
"The authors do not have a section for proposed changes. Hence, it is not completely clear which changes they are proposing and which changes are already existing. ",1
"The explanations are good.

But a layout in the issue-solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.",1
"The problem statements are much detailed, but they could be more concise.

The test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation.",1
the design covers all tthe major aspects well. I feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way.,1
"Design is very nicely explained with flowchart makes the design flow very clear. Suggestion : If a screenshot of actual screen where the change needs to be made is added, that would be perfect.",1
"Impressive write-up. Flow-charts and UML diagrams are well-explained.

Detailed explanation of problem statement and solution to be implemented.",1
lack of group members.   The design process is not very clear.,1
The doc focusses on eliminating the issue and does not shower any light on the design of the system.,1
"The overall quality of explanations is precise and clear.

Isssue 3 and the test plan can be addressed in more detail.

How the testing will be performed must be addressed.",1
The Issue 2 explanation ans Issue 1 solution 2 explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level. It needs to be broken down. All other descriptions are easy to follow. It would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.,1
proposed changes are well explanatory but every function change is in sign_up_sheet controller whereas there are many references present in a few models and other controllers as well,1
"The explanations given show that they have put thought into their project however in Issue 1 solution 2, they are not clear about the path ahead. They have vaguely stated that the solution might be complex.",1
"Great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. The design will definitely increase the response time.

Suggestion: Information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document Availability of such info would have been helpful.",1
"The only issue i feel is iapproach to issue 1 is a bit complex or not clear which may lead to

increasing the response time of the system.",1
As stated above all the references needs to be checked as signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.,1
"  More effort could have been expended on the design because in some places, they are not sure of the direction and just state that they might have to look into the code and discuss with the professor.",1
"There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good.

Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843. Check with the Professor once.",1
"The use of flowcharts  describe the functioning of the project exceptionally.

Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.",1
The UML diagrams does seems to be a bit at a high level. I couldn't get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented.,1
No diagrams shown,1
The diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. Suggestion : Test Plan is not so clear. Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart will make it very clear as to what you plan to test.,1
no such things like UML.,1
"The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project.",1
The document is almost complete. Includes proper planning and demonstration. Only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done. ,1
"I think technical design lacks details. the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work, where will the string be kept.

test plan should have more tests

"The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. The doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed.  

Suggestion: I feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate. The team did mention one scenario. I feel like there could have been many more. But, as all the required things are present, I am giving this post full stars. ",1
The functionality scope is restricted because of the topic but the design doc covers everything what all is required to be done in the project.,1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
"The design document was clear and concise; however, I would like to see more details on how routes.rb and the views will be edited to pull static strings from the en.yml file. The test plan section is not detailed enough.",1
"The document shows how they will be using the API. However, since it is initial they have not clearly mentioned the functionality required.",1
"All parts are presented, but need little fore explanation in test plan part.",1
"The explanations are done well but they could be more thorough. Why is the internationalization API and Google Translate needed? Also, will you use a script to edit the views? How would you do that? It seems like too much work to do manually.",1
The explanation for changes are just an overview of what needs to be done and does not focusses on the changes to be made in the files.,1
"The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project.",1

"The changes proposed are quite understandable. However, I would suggest them to clearly provide a clear path how they are going to reach their result. The initial planning is quite appreciable though.",1
changes could be explained in details. i think that is missing a bit. ,1
"The wireframes themselves make the project self-explanatory. That being said, enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given. Things like what API will be used to achieve the objective has been mentioned.

No suggestions.",1
"The design looks solid, but it's hard to tell without sufficient detail. If anything, causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more DRY and maintainable than what we have now. I wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work. The claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended, e.g. it would take too much time.",1
"The design  encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the  Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings  at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.",1
No code is mentioned to be checked ,1
The design seems sound. The team plans to add all translations of the static variables in a separate folder. I think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system. I would like to see this design in action before making a judgement.,1
"The document does not go much into the technical details. The limited details provided sounds right. However, more research will generate better understanding.",1

No diagrams present to explain behaviour design.,1

"Similar to my earlier comment, I found this document lacking on details. I also don't think their explanation for deriving the ""score"" to be sufficient. Their explanation is expressed as code, not as a mathematical equation.",1
Just overview is presented which is explained properly. The technical design is not explained in depth.,1
Changes are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more details.,1
They have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. But where this method is planned to be added in Expertiza  is unclear. This needs to be mentioned.,1
"The team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. However, as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement.",1
"It would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model.

This will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the ""smell"" category.",1
The design appears to be perfect for now except for the flow diagram,1
"From what I can gather, nothing sounds too complicated individually, but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very  cumbersome and complex. I don't see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues.",1
"This logic to calculate composite score :

composite score= Max score -[self review score - peer review score] is basically taking the min scores. Not sure what you are trying to achieve here . It is not a good measure to calculate composite score.",1
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  

Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  

1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Only a simple formula for composite score has been written.  

2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  

3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  

4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  

5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.",1
"The application flow help understands how your design work, but maybe  you can add more visual aids to help understand your design more easily.",1
No UMLs given,1
"There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  

1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities.

2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite.

3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail.

 ",1
No UML diagrams or screenshots have been included currently.,1
As mentioned above the flow diagram should be completely modified ,1
"Same comments as earlier. A flow chart diagram is provided, but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple. I would like to see more details about the process in an actor diagram.",1
Application flow is present and done well. UML diagrams need to be added.,1
The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.,1
The project's purpose and issues are well stated. But the project design have not been included.,1
"The design doc  for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions.",1

A couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.",1
"There are no diagrams present.

It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.",1
"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and  the solution approach.

The author has not suggested any changes as of now.,1
The author has not written any plans about the implementation. It only states the problem statement. The author needs to do more work in the writeup.,1

"The write up could've been organized in a better manner and the authors could've given more attention to detail. For example, I see they mention the project E1791 but without a hyperlink, it was a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project (the search bar didn't help matters too).  It could've been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented, and what improvement this one does.

Also, the document does not  cover testing - even some basic test cases.

(A little formatting inconsistency - the heading ""Flowchart"" always has a colon attached to it but none of the other headings do!)",1
The placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema. They have also not included the test cases,1

No testing plan or tests are specified. ,1
"everything looks great , you can add test plan for this as its a big change in functionalities.",1
"I felt there was just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year:  2017 Project  .

Even if the current project is to extend a previous one, the documents aren't supposed to be copied almost word to word. The only major addition I see is the last section.

None of the diagram correlate to the new changes being made; they are contextual to the older project.

Testing plan is missing from the document. From what I know, even the development projects need that section.

Even when the older document was used, no references have been provided for it.",1
"The introduction paragraph contains bullets that are identical to E1791 which is surprising.  

The flowchart does not cover ""No"" or negative cases and is thus incomplete. What is logged in the DB and how exactly is ""start"" and ""end"" time is very ambiguous.  

Apart from a mention of ""merging the data of the details page on the current report page."" in the introduction, I cannot see any further discussion of this particular  objective.

For auto-save, you could think of using the on-unload event of JavaScript (like onload event). Also, setTimeout doesn't seem to be an efficient idea, since that would make too many number of calls from the page (I guess you would be sending an Ajax request, which is asynchronous). A next call might be made before a previous call response is handled.

When you say ""For each time the reviewer starts a review, it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database. If it does exist then it will update the",1
The design incorporates all the required functionalities. The team could have added Use cases or CRC cards to help convey which parts of code they plan to change and how. Overall the team conveys their objectives.,1
No  all functionalities are not incorporated.  Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub is missing.,1
"Organization of the document is missing. It quotes a problem statement, presents a flowchart, and states a pair of objective-solutions yet again.

From this write up, I could understand that they're trying to do 3 things: log the time that each review takes (by improving an earlier project), auto-save reviews, and merge data of details page on report page.

I cannot find these clearly separated.",1
"While I understand conceptually, I don't believe they explained their changes in appropriate  detail. Simply describing additional columns and a flow chart misses the biggest part of these changes which is user experience. How will windows  pop-up? What will the new data look like after a review is complete?",1
The authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. They could benefit from drawing simple LoFi UI cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their UI design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it. Overall the have explained the process in detail and clean fashion.,1
The autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggy(not sure if it is in the scope of this project) so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of intervals like 5/10/15 mins,1
"explanation is good and easy to understand.

proposed solution looks good as well.

Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub hasn't been explained.",1
"The Introduction was a little confusing as to what this team is going to do. Rather the ""Objective of the project"" section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that I was able to understand what already exists.

The Objective of the project section contains the proposed solutions when the proposed solutions ought to be a separate section.",1
"I think the writing could be done better, with more explanation on why the solutions mentioned in the last paragraph are taken, and what other approaches were considered. Or an explanation of why no alternative exists.

With regard to design, explained in detail in a previous comment.",1
"These changes seem to be appropriate  for the objectives they have. Only a small set of files are being changed, and the functionality is isolated well. My only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking.",1
The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.,1
It isn't clear what all the Review statistics will be shown in the column. If it is just the time spent then that's fine. But if there are other details as well then it needs to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell w/o affecting readability.,1
"Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The objectives/goals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in future.The flowchart explains the functionality very well. Overall, the doc is easy to understand.

As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part.

It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps.

The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project.

The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies.

The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon.

Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views. ",1
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1
"  The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database.

Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1
the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks DRY. They haven' t mentioned any pattern as such. But overall the design document looks neat and very well written.,1
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work!

How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1
"Yes, the design is appropriate. It would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use.",1
"They have used the design patterns well, and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram (however, I'm not quite sure whether it's right to call the diagram as a UML diagram)",1
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin?

Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1
"The design appears to be a bit complex, as it involves interactions with two controllers, viz. review_mapping_controller and report_controller. The changes should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing methods of these controllers.

Nevertheless, the design is complete in itself, and the authors have tried to keep it as modular and clear as possible. A very good job here!",1
"Class diagrams are missing.

Class diagrams are missing.

First flow diagram looks perfect.

Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not  include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only.

You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10).

If yes, then don't add this new student and  show some proper error message to the user.

If no, then add the student.",1
"The mock UIs are well thought of and make navigation easier. A couple of suggestions:

- can add another mock UI showing the drop down.

- Some types of reports may not exist. If the drop down options are hard-coded, selecting an option might lead to a page with no content (this might be an existing issue I suspect). For every option, you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down.",1
The UML and flow Charts used by the teams are good but can be made more clear and appealing,1
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1
"The UML diagram is good, but the diagram in the test plan is not very helpful; I'd suggest either another UML-ish diagram or just a bulleted list of the features from the Report Controller.",1
"The visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern, use-cases to explain the test plan. The class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team, and it succeeds in explaining. They have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review. A sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other, as the design suggests so.",1
"Yes, the design is appropriate. It would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use.",1
"From the previous stage, the team has added the Use Case Diagram that efficiently describes the actors involved in the process. Also, since a new controller is proposed it was essential to identify the role of the instructor.",1
"  Yes, they have improved the UML diagram from last round and it, it's a standard class UML diagram. It's very self-explanatory. Though the diagram under test plan should be clearer. Also, there could have been a sample report generated for reference.",1
"I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  

I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system",1
"Tests are well covered. However, I don't see how the nicely constructed use case diagram is appropriate to be placed  in the ""Test Plan"" section.",1
Using a strategy pattern to solve this problem is one of the simplest approach according to me and team has selected the same thing. Only thing i would suggest the team is to be carefull when separating the classes as it might have some un-intended side affect.,1
Test plan needs to be expanded to describe each unit/functional test team plans to write for each of the reports. ,1
The testing plan is very neat and comprehensive. they could have handled more edge cases.,1
"The design appears to be a bit complex, as it involves interactions with two controllers, viz. review_mapping_controller and report_controller. The changes should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing methods of these controllers.

"The test plan  covers  all the reports and their creation, as well as data to be rendered using the new button added. You can try adding edge test cases, i.e. the code should not break if data is empty for a report. They have not yet posted the complete plan of testing, and plan to update as per the progress. I would suggest you to take time to define a testing strategy, as it will help in TDD which speeds up the process highly.",1
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. It 's adequate to test all functionality of the newly introduced controllers. It doesn't talk in detail about the ways the system is to be tested and what is the exact outcome to be verified.",1

Test plan needs to be expanded to describe each unit/functional test team plans to write for each of the reports. ,1
The technical changes required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly. This makes it difficult to understand the problem statement properly. Some high-level domain knowledge and requirements background will be helpful.,1

"The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed.

Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.",1
"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.",1
"Yes, the design includes a very good test plan. The tests are deep and detailed and completely test the functionalitys.

But I think it could be better following the DRY principle if the tester don't need to log in as administrator2 every time.",1
"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added.

The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)",1
"  

The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage.

This will make your code more rigid.",1
"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views.

I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.",1
"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.",1
"Yes, they had test plan, but only simple test plan, they should add some more corner cases.",1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the code in a simple manner.",1
Actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.,1
"They only presents a flow chart, it will be better if there is a UML diagram.",1
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented.",1
I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.,1
"The test plan doesn't seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation, it simply gives directions for running tests.",1
"They have Test plan, but I don't think they include test in it, they just put some examples about how to run their code.   ",1
The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.,1
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",1
"Actual project work has not been started  yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files  to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1
"Yes, they did include the test plan, but it's not enough, if just including files.",1
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,1
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1
"They have mentioned  that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1
"As said in the previous review, though the UI mockup explains the functionalities, it could have been more legible.",1
Test plan is discussed in the write up. It could have been supported with some use-cases.,1
"In the problem statement section, the first author should be reviewers I think.",1
1) Create class diagram and UML diagram outlining the set of actions that the reviewer and the author can perform.,1
Content is good and well written from the last review I was expecting little more in depth  deatails  on the implementation side .  I see no edits after Nov 14 except for the new image,1
Diagram included in the implementation plan is confusing. A better way would have been to include a diagram to indicate the step by step flow.,1
Test plan does not contain edge cases or the step by step procedure for performing test.,1
"The UI mockups are good. I'm not entirely sure that the UML diagram is effective, perhaps a better diagram style would work better.",1
Several tests are listed and described. I would suggest adding more details for each test as there is some vagueness as to what each described action entails. ,1
The authors have described the changes to be made. However these are very abstract and require some technical depth,1
  The design appears to be well made. However due to lack of more detail I am unable to judge it correctly. What changes need to be made in the files is not mentioned.,1
"  Yes the design is simple, however, as stated above it is very succinct and abstract. Only which files are going to be edited are written. What methods/interfaces will be modified is not mentioned.",1
  The diagrams have been enlarged and are now visible. Good improvement. However I still feel that computer made mockups would have looked cleaner.,1
  Yes the design includes a test plan in the end. This too is very abstract (about 5 lines total) and just states the use cases. Tip: use the 'it should' format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.,1
"They have a UML diagram which pretty much does it job. I am not in favor of the UI mockups they have put. They could have used any software for the same, which would have made it legible.",1
The test plan given is not concrete. Just mentions what should be done but no actual steps for them.,1
Problem statement is too brief. Design should 'talk' about proposed solution. Too short.,1
It's precise but some information missing.,1
Test Plan too brief. Could add scenarios and description. ,1
"The authors have made a really good attempt at explaining the changes to be made, however, I feel like few details could have been added to the previously done work and how they are going to improve it. ",1
"Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made.

This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots.

Good work team.

Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented.",1
"The author has very well given a background of the system and the problem, which forms a lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. However, the author has only given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an explanation, nor an implementation.",1
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the ""UML Diagram for Review"" section.  

  

 ",1
"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.",1
The doc is very well written. Its like a blueprint to the project. Really appreciate the team efforts!,1
"Team have explained the Problem/Steps to Reproduce are really very clear. Solution part could have been explained better.

Overall its a good work",1
"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !  

The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues. The UI mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand.   ",1
Mostly  yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.,1
The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1
Given UML diagram which  are explaining the functionality appropriately  but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change ,1
"Testing plan is not included. However, somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the steps to reproduce.",1
"There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated.

Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.",1
"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.",1
"Make include more details for test plan, other than that, the wiki looks very good.",1
Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.,1
"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1

Actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.,1
"This is a mozilla project and I am not sure what are the testing requirements and depth to be covered, as it is not mentioned in the document. But the steps mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done",1
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented.",1
It included a proper test plan. There was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete.,1
I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.,1
"The test plan doesn't seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation, it simply gives directions for running tests.",1
"They have Test plan, but I don't think they include test in it, they just put some examples about how to run their code.   ",1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.",1
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.  

  Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1
The authors have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using. They have mentioned the files that need to be modified.,1
"Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  

they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful",1
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to  support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  

Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,1
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1
The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,1
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1
"The team has very well explained the steps they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality. They have stated every change they would be making for the Change request in details. They have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement. However, the team has not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation.",1
"  The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database.

Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work!

How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions.

2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin?

If no, then add the student.",1
"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1
"The documentation looks great as a high-level design document.

Low-level technical details(code level) should also be  covered.",1
"The project consists of making a search function to select specific users, assignments etc using some criteria. So they're creating a search functionality for individual models.",1
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct  approach).

Any design patterns used???",1
The design document appears really easy to follow. A person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document.,1
The design appears to be simple. However any code modifications is  not mentioned yet as work project might not have started so far. it would be nice if a list of files to be modified were added.,1
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza  deployement  to show where the changes would be visible",1
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1
"Yes, a good test plan is also included",1
"Manual test plans as of now!

The team is planning to add Rspecs after implementation.",1
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1
"Yes, the changes are well explained. There are a lot of pictures, snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made.

There's one issue that the screenshots are not very clear, since it's big. It would look better of the screenshots can be clearer.",1
"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified.

Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.",1
"The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.  

The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table.

I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,",1
"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting.

One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.",1
"The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts  since the 1st round.

While this assignment does not require an extensive  discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better  if the document explicitly addressed this topic.",1
"yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.  

I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included.

On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots",1
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained  by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well.

The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.",1
"The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the  changes that are  necessary for the javascript library to work.

While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project,  it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all  the views as opposed to discussing only the ""view submissions"" table. ",1
"The design is simple, they are adding an external JQuery library to achieve the intended sorting functionality and will be adding custom js to achieve further functionalities. As indicated earlier, not clear as to this custom js will be included in multiple pages.",1
"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good,

But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly.

The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.",1
"The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed.

Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.",1
"The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram

The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon.

Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views. ",1
"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.",1
"Yes, the design includes a very good test plan. The tests are deep and detailed and completely test the functionalitys.

But I think it could be better following the DRY principle if the tester don't need to log in as administrator2 every time.",1
"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added.

The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)",1
"  

The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage.

This will make your code more rigid.",1
"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views.

I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.",1
"Yes, they had test plan, but only simple test plan, they should add some more corner cases.",1
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza  is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1
The authors have given sufficiently good explanation for the changes to be made to the system. They have explained which files they will change as well as the flow of the project.One thing that they have failed to mention is what API are they planning to use. I would like to know that as that would be a key piece of information for this document's completeness.,1
"The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.",1
"The authors mention within their UML diagrams section that they are making only HTML changes, however, they have still not explained how the requests will be sent,  no explanation  has been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the API.",1
The document does not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mentions the steps to be done in order to implement the required functionalities.,1
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,1
"Keeping the suggestion detection algorithm as a black box, as stated in the design document I will comment on the input and output to the algorithm. The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.",1
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",1
The actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned. But the files to be modified seem appropriate.,1
"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.",1
Can't say as code is not visible.,1
"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few.",1
The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.,1
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1
"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze"" button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.",1
"There is a test plan for part one of the problem state, however no implementation plan or test plan for part two.",1
Using google charts is a good idea.,1
"Actual project work has not been started  yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files  to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying. ,1
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",1
The document mentions the detailed test case that needs to be done but not how it will be done.,1
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,1
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,1
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1
The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement  is very minimal since most changes are in view.,1
"They have mentioned  that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1
"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least  added one actual test code for the  reviewer to verify.",1
"the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.",1
the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not.,1
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and  displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",1
The documentation is somewhat ambiguous,1
"The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc.",1
"The design is ambiguous. The team only said they will make ""some"" changes to the current system but didn't state clearly what kind of changes they will make and how these changes will be done. For example, for the first step, we need more information about how the team will change the UI, the model and the controller or helper to realize what the team said.",1
"I can't find any explanation for principles and patterns, maybe the authors should add them to wiki.",1
It seems the authors didn't have a clear and detailed plan about how to change the current system to meet the requirement. They got the direction to do the project but still lacked details to implement it.,1
"The approach is clear, but is not clear as to what changes will be needed in the system.",1
"Actually,, the design seems not simple. Due to the ambiguous of the design, I cannot tell clearly what the four links are used to do in the first step, but it seems too many links will be used and some strange conditions need to be checked before instructors can perform a review. In addition, it seems not all the instructors can do the reviews, so there may be some errors? Description for step 2 is also complex and seems include a lot of jobs need to do.",1
"The diagram only stated the current scenario..  There's no final picture, no UML diagram.

The figure didn't clearly describe the changes to be made to the system.

It should be better if there's a UML diagram from the user practice side, a diagram for the design plan, and also another figure for the final picture: how dows it look like when the plan is implemented.",1
"No, the proposed UI changes are only mentioned and the diagrams in the wiki are of the current system. Use draw.io for mockups and drawings.",1
Team has used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowcharts/UML to describe how they are solving the problem is missing. Adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better,1
Excellent use of visualizations!,1
No diagrams present,1
There are no UML diagrams. I would suggest them to include a test case diagram that can improve understandability.,1
The design lacks diagrams to state what the changes they will do and how it will be like after change. It is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed.,1
"There is a test plan, the tests are deep and detailed.

However, the current test plan is not enough to test the functionalities. They are just unit tests. It should be added with a tests that directed tests whether  the instructor can do the same kind of review as the students, from the user 's perspective (for example, log in, do the review, etc)",1
"The test plan is shallow. It only state what features the team will test but how the features will be test, what and how many cases will be included are not clear. The team should expand the plan for each features they aim to test, including specific steps and different cases.",1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1
The technical changes required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly. This makes it difficult to understand the problem statement properly. Some high-level domain knowledge and requirements background will be helpful.,1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1
"I don't exactly understand how the waveforms help to produce the sound for the new browser they're adding support for, but other than that, their approach seems solid.",1
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate.

The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate.",1
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains

 ",1
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the code in a simple manner.",1
Actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.,1
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1
"They only presents a flow chart, it will be better if there is a UML diagram.",1
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1
"This is a mozilla project and I am not sure what are the testing requirements and depth to be covered, as it is not mentioned in the document. But the steps mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done",1
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented.",1
Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. ,1
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1
I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.,1
"The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover.

I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.",1
"The test plan doesn't seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation, it simply gives directions for running tests.",1
"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.",1
"They have Test plan, but I don't think they include test in it, they just put some examples about how to run their code.   ",1
few more test cases can be added,1
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  

More so no mention of tests in the document.",1
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1
"The team has very well explained the steps they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality. They have stated every change they would be making for the Change request in details. They have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement. However, the team has not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation.",1
"  The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database.

Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work!

How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",1
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions.

2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin?

Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1
"Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  

Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ",1
"Class diagrams are missing.

Class diagrams are missing.

First flow diagram looks perfect.

Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not  include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only.

You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10).

If yes, then don't add this new student and  show some proper error message to the user.

If no, then add the student.",1
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1
"I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  

I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system",1
"design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used.

Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.",1
Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.  

 ",1
"The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities.

But nothing mentioned on how they will write.",1
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1
"The wiki could have been organized better.

It looks a little messy. Not self explanatory.

The Use case does not have any actors in it.

Suggestion: Code screenshots could have been placed better",1
"The files to be changed have been properly listed.

I feel more explanation ought be given as to why these files have been modified and in what way.",1
Less explanation on problem statement. Could have elaborated on the problem scenario and why changes needs to be made.,1
Their task introduction is too short. But the background part explain the changes very well.,1
"As mentioned in my previous review, I cannot understand the back-end design handling. Which controller and view files are being modified? or Will new methods or .erb files be added? Any plans to use third-party gems or API's?",1
"The design is appreciable.

There could be some more explanation and implementation details to it.",1
"The authors have explained well on what changes they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented. As I had suggested in my previous review, they can mention the expertiza files (controllers, views) involved. ",1
Design is too detailed. I would suggest keeping it short and precise.,1
"There is just one flow diagram which does explain the activities to happen.

There is no use case diagram with actors and all the uses cases expected.

Suggestion: The use case diagram would have given better clarity about the system",1
"The design does include enough test plans.

The team has provided the code screenshots for the same.

Suggestion: Could have put links to the git code so that the wiki could have been short and precise.",1
They have test plan part but not including specific plans.,1
5 Stars!  All but one problem has a snippet with the code fix and a rationale explaining why.,1
"The project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well-defined in the design document. The team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes.

The fix for the Issue #1008 - ""Issue related to staggered deadline"" is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code. One minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code. Moreover, the solution to the Issue #1072 - ""Issue related to instructor's assignment participation"" is not specific enough, i.e. it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes.

All in all, the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system.",1
flowcharts are simple to understand but no design patterns used.some supporting class diagrams or sequence diagrams would be helpful.,1
"You can add some more explaination of what exactly you'll do in issues like:  

Issue #1072 - Issue related to instructor's assignment participation. I felt information is missing here.",1
Fixes are simple adjustments to the current code. The last issue requires an addition of a full function but I think that it is appropriate to handle the bug fix as it pulls that responsibility out and keeps things nicely  separated and associated  for purpose.,1
  Yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand. This can be attributed to the fact that their issues are quite simple in nature. They could have provided some simple UI mockups of the changes.,1
"For each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed. Aside from the Issue #1072 all the solutions seem reasonable and simple.

One minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the .collect instead of the .each method for computing total_weight in validate_assignment_questionnaires_weights method.",1
figures are drawn but are not explained in detail.,1
"As mentioned designs are well depicted and no Mock UI can be found but at this stage, UI is not a priority for the project.",1
"the design includes test plan.Manual testing is emphasized more than automation testing.

Moreover how automation testing will be done has not been described.",1
"The test plan is present. It is broken down into separate sections for each of the five issues. Each section is further broken down into a manual and automated testing parts. While the sections for manual testing are comprehensive, the sections for automated tests are too general and do not provide a clear vision for what types of changes are going to be introduced.

I would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec.",1
"It seems to me that the implementation of the project has not started yet. Hence, the exact place in the Expertiza  code where they plan to make changes is missing. This should be added in my opinion.

Additionally, they have explained very well as to what changes need to be done and how they will be done. So, good job there.",1
"Yes, the changes to be made are nicely explain.

The diagrams and screenshots are in place.

Suggestion: There was more scope to the test plans",1
No. Not clear,1
The authors haven;t given the files to be modified or the changes they are going to do to the system.,1
The design doc explains the project in detail. I would suggest that the description could be  modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. Also what MVC files are being touched could have been mentioned.,1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1
"The design does appear to be sound.

The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well.

The screenshots of the UI are also present.

Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points.",1
"The overall design looks good. The score calculation formula still looks a bit weird. Using the current formula, it is possible to have a higher composite score than each of the individual scores , which should not be the case. ",1
There is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation.,1
Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.,1
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the code in a simple manner.",1
"The design looks good.

But from the implementation details given and the amount of use cases listed, I feel there could be some more implementation details that are left out.",1
Complex design,1
The explanation and the diagrams don't match exactly. The explanation says user should be able to see composite and peer review scores only after he completes his own review. That is not captured in the flow diagram. Else it is self explanatory,1
"The UML diagrams are  detailed and explained well.

Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.",1
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system. ",1
"The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement.

Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.",1
"The test plan can be more elaborate and complete.

This will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.",1
"The design has been listed with a few test plans.

I feel that there could be more tests included.

Suggestion: Test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if TDD approach is used.",1
No tests,1
Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements,1
Test plan is very shallow. Only the headings are mentioned. A proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.,1
There is no proper test plan. The authors have just mentioned the required tests that needs to be done. No proper explanation has been given about how these tests will be implemented.,1
"No, not really, the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing Expertiza algorithm works. So it would help if they showed the same. ",1
The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?,1
"  The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",1
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate.

The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate.",1
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains

 ",1
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1
"Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.",1
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1
"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  

Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system

 ",1
"  The photos included are superb at showing the expected View. 

They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots.

Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?",1
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1
"The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover.

I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.",1
few more test cases can be added,1
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1
Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.,1
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  

More so no mention of tests in the document.",1
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",1
"Actual project work has not been started  yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files  to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying. ,1
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",1
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,1
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1
"Yes, they did include the test plan, but it's not enough, if just including files.",1
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,1
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1
"They have mentioned  that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics",1
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza  is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1
The authors have given sufficiently good explanation for the changes to be made to the system. They have explained which files they will change as well as the flow of the project.One thing that they have failed to mention is what API are they planning to use. I would like to know that as that would be a key piece of information for this document's completeness.,1
"The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.",1
"The authors mention within their UML diagrams section that they are making only HTML changes, however, they have still not explained how the requests will be sent,  no explanation  has been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the API.",1
The document does not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mentions the steps to be done in order to implement the required functionalities.,1
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",1
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,1
"Keeping the suggestion detection algorithm as a black box, as stated in the design document I will comment on the input and output to the algorithm. The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.",1
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",1
"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.",1
Can't say as code is not visible.,1
"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few.",1
"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze"" button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.",1
"There is a test plan for part one of the problem state, however no implementation plan or test plan for part two.",1
I think more tests can be added,1
The document mentions the detailed test case that needs to be done but not how it will be done.,1
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,1
"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least  added one actual test code for the  reviewer to verify.",1
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and  displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",1
"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.",1
"design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used.

Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.",1
Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.  

 ",1
"The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI  with indication on it make it more useful.",1
"The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities.

But nothing mentioned on how they will write.",1
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1
"The background is clear and thorough but the explanation of the changes to be made to the system lack detail. Terms such as DOM, the Blob APi, and ECMAScript were not explained.",1
"The page feel more like a project report instead of wiki page. They should not tell people to ""go through the following page"", instead they should just tell, ""the page"" is previous work.",1
"They list the files to be changed for the final stage of the project, but the description of what will be changed is still lacking. I'd love to see screenshots of added code, or an explanation of what is and is not needed.",1
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as a part of the OSS project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as a part of the final project. Detailed information on the changes already made is available as a Wiki link to the previous document. This document clearly captures the implementation of the OffScreenCanvas Webidl and Rust files. The design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of- implementation of the OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D and enabling of the blob API for testing the code. The authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed, making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on Github.

Though the text is lucid, lack of a visual tool- (like flow charts, tables or UML diagrams) to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the functionalities proposed and the interlinking of various modules. So, one suggestion at this point is that t",1
The authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system. Ot would have been better if some visual modes are added.,1
"The authors do a great job of explaining the technical details and the api functionality of the requirements. Furthermore, they provide a list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project. However, the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes. For example the description of high level changes pertaining to the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D is adequate, but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out.",1
"There is less about what they gonna do, but more about ""before and after part""",1
need to include a flow diagram,1
"The design sounds good, but that's largely due to how vague it is: naturally we want to add the things we need to add, and remove the things we need to remove.",1
The authors have not mentioned the name of the design pattern used but have mentioned the steps for implementation.,1
"The design does appear to be sound, which involves the Rust implementation of the Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas and OffScreenCanvasContext2D Web IDL file. I look forward to the complete implementation of the project.",1
The high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable. The problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution. I would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader. For example the authors talk about reusing the code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and WebGLRenderingContext. It would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified. For example patterns like Decorator or Adapter would be relevant for this case.,1
not very well. lack of the use case.,1
"There is less about what they gonna do, but more about ""before and after part""",1
"The design is indeed very simple, because I don't know what it will actually entail to complete the last part.",1
redundant description.,1
"Though the team have explained their work pretty well, the team should think about adding a few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project. Currently the team have not used any diagrams.",1
It would be nice to see a mockup of the off-screen canvas.,1
A suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the offscreenCanvas does would be helpful.,1
Still no visualizations of any kind,1
No there is not any chart.,1
"No, they didnt use any visualization.",1
No new visualizations were added for the fourth part of the project.,1
"The current document does not include a visualization tool- inclusion of such a tool would have made the document more readable. Nevertheless the link to the Wiki of the previous document includes a flow diagram that clearly outlines the code flow of how the control flows from the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas web IDL file to its Rust implementation in OffScreenCanvas.rs, to the DOM implementation and finally to the renderer. ",1
The design does not include any kind of diagram. It would have been better if a flowchart or a class diagram could have been included in the document.,1
It would have been better if some screenshots and UML diagrams was added to the design doc to better explain the functionality.,1
There are no diagrams present in the document. While the diagrams for apis and class interactions may have been helpful they are not necessary for this project as the authors provide a detailed explanation of the relevant functionalities.,1
no diagram,1
"hough the team have explained their work pretty  well, the have not included a test plan. It is an important part of the project and should be included",1
"The test plan is clear but shallow. Finer grain tests should be described, not simply functional tests.",1
There is no test plan.,1
No there is no test plan,1
"No, they didnt include any test plan in their design.",1
No test plan has been mentioned.,1
The document does not include any test plan,1
No test plan was provided for the part 4 project.,1
It would have been better if a test plan covering changes made to the system was added to the design doc.,1
"The test plan is not included in the design document. While the instances of testing  are certainly mentioned, e.g. ""specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way."" and ""Finally, we'll test our code by enabling the blob API."" the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested.",1
"no.

not mention about that.",1
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza  is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1

"Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time.

However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1
"The documentation looks great as a high-level design document.

Low-level technical details(code level) should also be  covered.",1
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct  approach).

Any design patterns used???",1
"The design follows appropriate principles, but no design patterns have been used.",1
The design appears to be simple. However any code modifications is  not mentioned yet as work project might not have started so far. it would be nice if a list of files to be modified were added.,1
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1
"Not enough!

Add use case diagrams and flow diagrams.",1
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1
"Manual test plans as of now!

The team is planning to add Rspecs after implementation.",1
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1
"Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up.

No suggestions required.",1
"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.",1
"design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used.

Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.",1

The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1
"Yes, well designed document. UI mock-ups given. It is structured. ",1
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,1
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.  

  Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1
No design found on the wiki. Not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.,1
The authors have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using. They have mentioned the files that need to be modified.,1
The design appears to be clear. The inclusion of a visual aid that shows how the control transfers from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help readers better understand the design.   ,1
"The design is quite good. It clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. However, the only suggestion would be to include more UML diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable.",1
"Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  

they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful",1
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1
"The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English.",1
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to  support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1
No visualization or diagrams are necessary.,1
Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots.,1
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  

Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,1
The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,1
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,1
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1
The authors haven;t given the files to be modified or the changes they are going to do to the system.,1
The design doc explains the project in detail. I would suggest that the description could be  modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. Also what MVC files are being touched could have been mentioned.,1
No. Not clear,1
"Yes, the changes to be made are nicely explain.

The diagrams and screenshots are in place.

Suggestion: There was more scope to the test plans",1
"It seems to me that the implementation of the project has not started yet. Hence, the exact place in the Expertiza  code where they plan to make changes is missing. This should be added in my opinion.

Additionally, they have explained very well as to what changes need to be done and how they will be done. So, good job there.",1
Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.,1
There is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation.,1
"The overall design looks good. The score calculation formula still looks a bit weird. Using the current formula, it is possible to have a higher composite score than each of the individual scores , which should not be the case. ",1
"The design does appear to be sound.

The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well.

The screenshots of the UI are also present.

Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points.",1
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1
Complex design,1
"The design looks good.

But from the implementation details given and the amount of use cases listed, I feel there could be some more implementation details that are left out.",1
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the code in a simple manner.",1
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system. ",1
yes the application flow diagram tells of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the students for the particular functionalities ,1
The explanation and the diagrams don't match exactly. The explanation says user should be able to see composite and peer review scores only after he completes his own review. That is not captured in the flow diagram. Else it is self explanatory,1
"No, not really, the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing Expertiza algorithm works. So it would help if they showed the same. ",1
The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?,1
The test plan added is just a basic case and as the changes are just some calculations to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project.,1
Test plan is very shallow. Only the headings are mentioned. A proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.,1
There is no proper test plan. The authors have just mentioned the required tests that needs to be done. No proper explanation has been given about how these tests will be implemented.,1
No tests,1
Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements,1
"The design has been listed with a few test plans.

I feel that there could be more tests included.

Suggestion: Test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if TDD approach is used.",1
"The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement.

Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.",1
"The test plan can be more elaborate and complete.

This will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.",1
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.,1
"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.",1
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,1
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",1
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.  

  Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1
No design found on the wiki. Not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.,1
The authors have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using. They have mentioned the files that need to be modified.,1
The design appears to be clear. The inclusion of a visual aid that shows how the control transfers from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help readers better understand the design.   ,1
"The design is quite good. It clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. However, the only suggestion would be to include more UML diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable.",1
"Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  

they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful",1
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1
"The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English.",1
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to  support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1
Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots.,1
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1
"There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document.

Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.",1
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  

Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,1
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,1
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,1
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1
"The issues have been identified and documented clearly.  However, a little more of explanation is required for the  solutions proposed for issues 2 - 5. They seem to me at a very high level.",1
"Testing plan is not included. However, somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the steps to reproduce.",1
"There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated.

Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.",1
"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1
The explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read.,1
The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1
"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.",1
Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.,1
"Make include more details for test plan, other than that, the wiki looks very good.",1
Mostly  yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.,1
The design  document is  easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,1
Given UML diagram which  are explaining the functionality appropriately  but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change ,1
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1
"The author has very well given a background of the system and the problem, which forms a lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. However, the author has only given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an explanation, nor an implementation.",1
"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.",1
"Yes, the explanations  provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned . The authors are very clear what and where to make changes.  Use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily.

Suggestion: No test plan is included in the project",1
Yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student,1
Actually they talked a little about previous work from E1791 project and a lot about what they gonna do. But it's better to have some contrast.   ,1
the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. Though the team hasn't made any changes since the last update. The team could have added a UML diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.,1
Not so good structure. ,1
The team has clearly defined the objective of the project. The have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. They have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review. The only thing the team could have added was to create a UML diagram defining the classes that are changed or added and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified/added. The team haven't mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed plan explains the idea well.,1

The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.

Team could have added, screenshots of the Expertiza pages, that would have helped us understand whoch part of the system is changing well.",1
The usecase diagram is helpful but does not help much as it just explains what is provided in the approach section. More in-depth functionality of what each user will do or how will the design flow (flow chart) would be more helpful.,1
The UML Use Case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. It makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario. ,1
"The test plan gives a black box testing view which is good and easy to understand. But it would be helpful to give more details about what functionalities are tested. Like a new DB table is added. So tests related to that and corner cases such as an old assignment gets removed , foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better.",1
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams and visualized images. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.   ,1
Self explanatory visual changes have been added. All the changes are described via the visual aids.,1
